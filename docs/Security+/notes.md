Just a way I remember the SDLC Phases: Planning (Planning and Analysis) School (Software/Systems Design) Is (Implementation) Tough (Testing) In (Integration) Detroit (Deployment) Michigan (Maintenance)

I'd highly recommend knowing the attack types or the various plans/strategies/policies to prevent bad stuff from happening (think business continuity, RPO, RTO, MTRP, MTBF, etc.)

But like others have said make sure you understand the acronyms and understand the different types of attacks and how to mitigate them.

Tips: Understand the type of attacks, ACLs, what tools do what (think of tools you may find on a Kali machine), and understand asymmetric vs symmetric.
