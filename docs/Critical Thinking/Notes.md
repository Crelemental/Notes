The point of comparing inferences i and d is to see the two fundamentally different sorts of inference. We call an inference **inductive** if the support the premises intend to provide for the conclusion is less than certain—if the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. We call an inference **deductive** if the premises intend to provide conclusive support for the conclusion—if they intend to guarantee the conclusion or make the conclusion certain.

- **Deduction:** arguments where the premises guarantee or necessitate the conclusion

— mathematical arguments, logical arguments, arguments from definition

- **Induction:** arguments where the premises make the conclusion probable

— analogies, authority, causal inferences, scientific reasoning, extrapolations, etc.

- **Inference to the best explanation or abduction:** arguments where the best available explanation is chosen as the correct explanation

Truth, Validity, Soundness: Brief

- **Truth:** A true proposition accurately represents reality. 
- **Validity:** In a good deductive argument structure, true premises would make the conclusion necessarily true. (If not, it is an invalid structure.)
- **Soundness:** A deductive argument is sound if it has a valid structure and all its premises are true. (If an argument is deductive but has either an invalid structure or at least one false premise, then it is an unsound argument.)

**All True Premises + Strong Inductive Support = Cogent Argument**

Truth, Strength, Cogency: Brief

- **Truth:** Propositions are true if they accurately represent what is the case, otherwise they are false.
- **Strength:** In an inductive argument, the truth of the premises would make the conclusion probably true.
- **Cogency:** An inductive argument is cogent if it is strong and all its premises are true. (If an argument is inductive but either is weak or has at least one false premise, then it is an uncogent argument.)

**All True Premises + Strong Inductive Support = Cogency Argument**

Key Terms

- **Truth:** Propositions are true if they accurately represent what is the case, otherwise they are false. 
- **Soundness:** A deductive argument is sound if it has a valid structure and all its premises are true. (If an argument is deductive but has either an invalid structure or at least one false premise, then it is an unsound argument.)
- **Validity:** In a valid deductive argument, the truth of the premises would make the conclusion necessarily true. (If not, it is an invalid structure.)
- **Strength:** In a strong inductive argument, the truth of premises would make the conclusion probably true.
- **Cogency:** An inductive argument is cogent if it is strong and all its premises are true. (If an argument is inductive but either is weak or has at least one false premise, then is is an uncogent argument.)
- **Cognitive bias:** The way we naturally categorize and make sense of the world around us.
- **Alief**: An automatic belief-like attitude that can explain how our instinctual responses can conflict with our reasoned-out beliefs.
So, when you commit the **formal fallacy** of affirming the consequent, it means you have made an argument with a bad structure. A fallacy is a flawed argument, and a formal fallacy is an argument that has a flawed structure.  Alternatively, when you commit an **informal fallacy**, it means the structure of your argument is not what is at issue. Instead, someone takes exception to the content of your argument. Consider these examples one at a time, so you can see the distinction more clearly.
