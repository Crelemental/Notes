You need to keep people *accountable* meaning they're responsible for their actions, especially keeping track how they access sensitive data.  Measures put in place to ensure accountability is *auditing*, which is the process of reviewing an organization's records or information. 

**Accountability**
	you have to trace all activities in an environment back to its sources. Have to use identification, authentication, and authorization processes so you know who a given event is associated with and what permissions allowed them to carry it out.

	**Nonrepudiation** refers to a situation in which an individual is unable to successfully deny that they have made a statement or taken an action, generally because we have sufficient evidence that they did.
	**Deterrence**. Accountability is a great deterrent against misbehavior in environments. It lies in letting people know they will be held accountable for their actions.
