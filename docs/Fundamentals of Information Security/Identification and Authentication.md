 *Identification* makes a claim about what someone or something is, and *authentication* establishes whether this claim is true. 

*Authentication* is the set of methods used to establish whether a claim of identity is true. It doesnt decide what the party is permitted to do, thats *authorization.*

Factors are: Something you know, something you are, something you have, something you do, where you are.

**Multifactor/2factor authentication** uses multiple factors stated above. 

**Mutual Authentication** is a mechanism where both parties in a transaction authenticate each other. Typically software-based. Usually relies on Digital Certificates. Without it, you're susceptible to man in the middle attacks. The attacker could impersonate the server to the client and the client to the server, then intercepting traffic.![[Pasted image 20231005134726.png]]
