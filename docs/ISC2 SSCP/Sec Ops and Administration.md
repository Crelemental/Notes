**Code of Ethics** 1.1 https://www.isc2.org/ethics
Preamble
	ISC2 members are professionals and are expected to behave in an ethical manner. They are expected to make difficult ethical decisions and to support one another in doing so. While the board recognizes its obligation to provide the certificate holder with guidance on making ethical decisions, it does not expect to supervise or judge professionals in making these difficult decisions. The board recognizes its responsibility to maintain the integrity of the certification. It accepts that, from time to time, the good of the profession may require it to disassociate the profession from egregious behavior on the part of a particular certificate holder. It intends to deal with necessary complaints in a timely manner. This document describes the procedure to be used when complaints are necessary. By publishing these procedures, the board does not expect, invite, solicit, or encourage such complaints. The use of these procedures is for the sole purpose of protecting the reputation of the profession. They are not intended to be used to coerce or punish certificate holders.
Confidentiality
	The board and its agents undertake to keep the identity of the complainant and respondent in any complaint confidential from the general public. While disclosure of the identity of the complainant will be avoided where possible, upon filing a complaint, the complainant implies consent to disclose his identity to the respondent, where the board or its agents deem it necessary for due process. Actions of the board may be published at its discretion. Parties are encouraged to maintain confidentiality and certificate holders are reminded of their obligation to protect the profession.
Specificity of Complaints
	The committee will consider only complaints that specify the canon of our ISC2 Code of Ethics that has been violated. If you are unsure of the canon violated, file the complaint to the best of your ability or contact the Ethics Committee contact listed at the end of these procedures.
Professional Conduct Committee
	The Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee is a standing committee to assist ISC2 in the review of allegations of ethical misconduct of ISC2 members. It is established to oversee the application of the ISC2 Code of Ethics as it relates to exam candidate eligibility, deliver recommendations concerning the enforcement of the ISC2 Code of Ethics, and periodically review and recommend revisions to the Code. Learn more about the [Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee](https://www.isc2.org/about/governance/professional-conduct-committee).
Standing of Complainant
	Complaints will be accepted only from those who claim to be injured by the alleged behavior. While any member of the public may complain about a breach of Canons I or II, only principals (those with an employer/contractor relationship with the certificate holder) may complain about violations of Canons III, and only other professionals (those who are certified or licensed as a professional AND also subscribe to a code of ethics) may complain about violations of Canon IV.
Form of Complaints
	All complaints must be in writing. The committee is not an investigative body and does not have investigative resources. Only information submitted in writing will be considered. Two copies must be submitted. One in written form and the other in PDF.  
	Complaints must be in the form of a sworn affidavit. The committee will not consider allegations in any other form. - [Download an Ethics Complaint Affidavit Form](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/documents/ethics/ethicscomplaint.doc?rev=e050f36d0b11403183059cc09d11f68d&hash=7357E2371DA9B34946555FAB475E65F6)  
	Complaints should be sufficiently complete to enable the board to reach an appropriate judgment. At a minimum, the affidavit should specify the respondent, the behavior complained of, the canon breached, the standing of the complainant, and any corroborating evidence.  
	**Neither the board nor its committee is an investigative body and neither has the authority to compel testimony. We can consider only evidence submitted to us voluntarily. There may be many cases where this evidence is not sufficient to support any action. We can proceed only where a prima facie case is made. Where no such case is made, the committee will close the complaint without prejudice to either party.**
Committee Procedures
	Where a prima facie case has been made, the Ethics Committee will review and tender a recommendation to the board.
Rights of Respondents
	Respondents to complaints are entitled to timely notification of complaints. It is the intent of the board and its agents to notify the respondent within thirty days from receipt of the complaint. The respondent is entitled to see all complaints, evidence, and other documents. The respondent will have thirty days from accepting and acknowledging delivery to submit information in defense, explanation, rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation. As with the complaint, in order to be considered this information must be in the form of a sworn affidavit. As in the law, silence implies consent. That is, to the extent that the respondent is silent, the committee may assume that he does not dispute the allegations. The committee may grant necessary extensions of time to the respondent upon request.
Disagreement on the Facts
	Where there is disagreement between the parties over the facts alleged, the Ethics Committee, at its sole discretion, may invite additional corroboration, exculpation, rebuttals and sur-rebuttals in an attempt to resolve such dispute. The committee is not under any obligation to make a finding where the facts remain in dispute between the parties. Where the committee is not able to reach a conclusion on the facts, the benefit of all doubt goes to the respondent. That is to say, where the respondent disputes the facts alleged, then the burden of proof is on the complainant.
Findings and Recommendations
	The Ethics Committee will submit findings and recommendations for action to the board. In reaching its findings, the committee will consider any published guidance that has been given to certificate holders. In reaching its recommendations, the committee will prefer the most limited and conservative action consistent with its findings.
Notification and Right of Comment
	The Ethics Committee will notify the parties of its recommendation prior to any board action. Parties have 14 days submit a response or comments on the recommendations for consideration by the board.
Disciplinary Action
	Discipline of certificate holders is at the sole discretion of the board. Decisions of the board are final.
Final Disposition
	Parties will be notified of the final disposition within thirty days of board action. All complaints should comply with the procedure stated and be mailed to the following address:

**Understand** 1.2
CIA
Accountability: "audit" can a transaction be ascribed to a given user/system
Privacy: How information about someone may be gathered or used
Nonrepudiation: A user cannot deny taking part in a transaction
Least Privilege
Segregation of duties: purposefully adding inefficiency to a process such that no one person can complete a given task

**Understand** 1.3
Technical controls
	Anything done with or by an IT system
	ie session timeout, password aging, firewalls, AV solutions
Physical controls
	Anything with a tangible presence
	ie cameras, mantraps, locks, turnstiles, fences, bollards
Administrative controls
	Any government / procedures that restrain activity
	security policies -  how the org approaches a given topic and names that standard that it follows
	standards -  a set of directives that an org follows (ISO / NIST) or internal
	processes - detailed set of steps on how to do something, written by offices conducting those processes
	baselines - a set of configs / settings that should be applied for similar tech around the org
Assessing compliance
	ways an org can determine if the standards are being met
	both for performance and security
	should be continual
	see 7.4*
Periodic audit and review

**Understand** 1.4
Deterrent controls
	Dissuades an attacker
	ie Barbed wire
Preventative controls
	Prevent access or exfiltration
	ie a Wall
Detective controls
	Sense attack/anomalous activity
Corrective controls
	Changes a non-secure state to a more secure state
Compensating controls
	replaces a required control with a substitute

**Understand** 1.5
Asset management lifecycle
Process planning design and initiation
	Asset is anything that has value tangible or intangible
	Must be based on policies** 
Development and Acquisition
	Assets can be acquired any way - direct sale COTS (commercial off the shelf) or - custom built internally
	If using a contract process - **ENSURE SECURITY IS AN ASPECT OF EVERY PHASE:** define requirements - posting the request for proposal - scoring responses - negotiating terms - monitoring/inspecting delivered assets - operational lifetime support
Inventory and licensing
	Asset inventory is crucial
		You cant protect what you don't know you have
		should be part of the secure acquisition process
	Intellectual property (software) often requires licensing
		Site/seat/enterprise
		freeware/trial/adware
		open source/creative commons
		Custodial/library are essential
		Often open to unannounced vendor audits
Implementation/Assessment
	All tasks must be assigned to specific parties
	For enforcement, activities must be monitored and audited
Operation/Maintenance
	Continual assessment is crucial
		performance
		security
		controls
	Long term maintenance is important
		vendor updates/upgrades/patches
		re-assessment to determine if current needs are met
	Everything breaks
Archiving and retention
	Moving data/systems from production environment to long-term storage
	Retention: amount of time data/systems are kept
		statutory/regulations
		contractual
		best practice: minimize retention periods- reduces cost and risk
Disposal and destruction
	Secure removal is essential
		hardware/software
			ensure dependencies are addressed
			ensure no data remanence 
		data
			secure sanitization
				overwriting
				degaussing
				cryptoshredding/cryptographic erasure
				physical destruction

**Understand** 1.6
Change management lifecycle
	Configs/inventories don't stay constant; changes need to go through a formal secure process dictated by policy
	Typically use a Change Management Board (CMB) or Change Control Board (CCB)
		composed of participants from different stakeholders within the org (IT, security, HR, management, finance)
	Typical process: request, review, approval/disapproval, test, implementation, long-term maintenance and operation, disposal
Security impact analysis
	Concept of reviewing proposed changes to determine whether they will have adverse impact to enterprise security is valid and sensible
	Term "Business impact analysis" is widely used, and very worthwhile to understand. BIA is a very important tool for many security and non-security purposes
Configuration management
	Practice of creating and maintaining an inventory of assets and settings for each
		provisioning: should be part of secure acquisition process
		baseline: a selection of settings for a particular system, type of system, group of systems, or enterprise - designed to create uniformity and security
		automation- application of the baseline and monitoring to check configurations

**Understand** 1.7
Implementing security awareness and training
Awareness: general knowledge. for all personnel
Training: specific skills for participants
Social engineering: using techniques to leverage users/personnel instead of systems
Phishing: a form of social engineering using email
Methods and techniques to present awareness and training
	self-paced/online/CBT
	gamification
Periodic content reviews
Program effectiveness evaluation

**Understand** 1.8
Collaborate with physical security operations (defense in depth)
One entrance, many exits
Badges can incorporate biometrics (photos), barcodes, RFID, magnetic keys, etc...
	Different coded badges for different users/purposes
Two-person integrity for sensitive areas
Visitors should be treated differently
Lighting discourages attackers and enhances observation
Secure architecture is boring
Physical security should be provided by physical security professionals (CPP - Certified Protection Professional)
