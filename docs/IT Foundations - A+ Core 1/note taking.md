Variations of USB 3.x introduced new connector form factors and faster transfer rates than previous versions. USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 is capable of speeds up to 10 Gbps.

The USB 3.2 Gen 1 Superspeed USB standard is capable of up to 5 Gbps. The legacy designation of this standard is USB 3.0.

The USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Superspeed USB is capable of 2 x 10 Gbps. While other standards can use a variety of connector types, this standard strictly uses USB-C.

USB 2.0 is a high speed standard that specifies a data rate of 480 Mbps that is shared between all devices attached to the same controller.

### 2
DVI-I is a technology that is capable of connecting a digital source to an analog display or an analog source to a digital display. A VGA to DVI-I cable will connect your digital computer to an analog monitor.

### 3
A technician suggests purchasing a new computer that features CMP capabilities to handle the user's workload. 
	chip level multiprocessing (CMP).
	1. Multiple processing cores combined in the same package

### 4
Since the data scientist needs speed and computing power and is not concerned about data loss, RAID 0 is the best option. RAID 0 uses striping and spreads data across all disks in the array, sacrificing redundancy for speed.

RAID 1 uses mirroring with two disks. If one disk fails, the other takes over.

RAID 5 uses striping with distributed parity, meaning all information is spread across all disks in the array so that if one disk fails, data can be reconstructed from the remaining disks.

RAID 10 uses logical striping with two mirrored arrays. This configuration offers solid fault tolerance since a disk in each mirror can fail and the volume will still be available.

### 5
what are the three items that define a problem? (Select all that apply.)
	Cause, Symptom, Consequence

### 6
no POST and no display
	Check CPU
	Check all non essentail devices

Which setting does the engineer use to measure dBi?
	Antenna gain is in dBI
	Transmit power and EIRP is dBm

### 8
An engineer plans a fiber cable implementation between two campus buildings about 50 kilometers apart. Due to the distance between the locations, the engineer selects single-mode fiber. What specifications does the engineer need to consider with this decision?
	Single-mode fiber (SMF) has a small core (8-10 microns) and is designed to carry a long wavelength over long distances.

### 9
The 802.3af standard allows powered devices to draw up to about 13 W. Power is supplied as 350mA@48V and limited to 15.4 W. Usable wattage usually falls around 13 W.

The 802.3at (PoE+) standard allows powered devices to draw up to about 25 W, with a maximum current of 600 mA.

The 802.3bt (PoE++ or 4PPoE) supplies up to about 51 W (Type 3) or 73 W (Type 4) usable power.

The 802.3 standard is an overall arching standard that covers Ethernet usage. While the implementation falls under 802.3, it is not specific to the application.

### 10
A MAC address consists of 48 binary digits, making it 6 bytes in size. MAC addresses are represented in hexadecimal and each hex digit represents half a byte.

### 11
 To support such a legacy system on the network, what common port settings are enabled for communications?
	 137-139 NETBIOS
### 12
 During the final stages of configuration, the systems administrator creates a policy within the Domain Name System (DNS) to handle authentication failures.
	 The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) framework ensures that SPF and DKIM are being utilized effectively. DMARC specifies a policy mechanism for senders to specify how authentication failures should be treated.

### 13
A department within an organization would like to share a specific set of files with external users from a Windows 10 system. The users will also need to save files as well. Which solution does the systems administrator configure without needing to directly require Windows permissions?
	File Transfer Protocol-Secure (FTPS) allows a client to upload and download files from a network server. An FTPS server can be easily configured without the need for local user accounts.

### 14
Which protocol enables the ability for the printer to have an automatically populated address book.
	The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a TCP/IP protocol used to query and update resources in an X.500 directory. It is widely supported in current directory products such as Windows Active Directory.

### 15
A switch is put in place on the edge of the network to protect the server and protect against unauthorized traffic. What role does the switch play in the implementation?
	A network access server (NAS) or network access point (NAP) is an access appliance, such as a switch, access point, a firewall, or a VPN gateway. It is the device that a system makes a connection to in order to access a network.

### 16
Interference can cause port flapping too, (On top of Bad cabling and a Faulty port)

### 17
A security team at a company discovers that malware is rapidly moving from one virtual machine to another in a live environment. What security issue is occurring?
	Virtual machine escaping (VM escaping) refers to malware running on a guest OS jumping to another guest or to the host system itself.

### 18
Systems administrators deploy a virtualization solution that separates host resources for each instance at the operating system level. Which solution is running?
	With a container, resource separation occurs at the OS level. The OS defines isolated containers for each user instance to run in. Each container is allocated CPU and memory resources, but the processes run through the native OS kernel.

### 19 
A company realizes that it needs to implement a management solution for mobile phones. Which solution is specific to the restriction of apps installed from a device’s app store?
	Mobile application management (MAM) is part of an enterprise mobility management (EMM) suite that sets policies for apps that can process corporate data and prevents data transfer to personal apps. This type of solution configures an enterprise-managed container or workspace.

### 20
A universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) port was traditionally a physical serial port in a legacy system. In a modern mobile device, how can a UART be utilized? (Select all that apply.)
	Bluetooth and USB

### 21
IT determines that the display uses a very early thin film transistor (TFT) technology and will replace the laptop. Which TFT technology does the display use?
	In an early TFT implementation, twisted nematic (TN) crystals twist or untwist in response to the voltage level. This is the earliest type of TFT technology that can be in budget displays.

### 22
A user contacts a printer technician to report that every print job sent to a laser printer has lines of toner in the same location on every page that is printed. What does the technician suggest may need cleaning or replacing?
	Marks that appear in the same place (referred to as repetitive defects) are often due to dirty feed rollers or a damaged or dirty photosensitive drum.

### 23
The office laser printer starts printing pages that smudge easily. The IT specialist is proficient in the common printing defects of laser printers and knows what is causing the problem. What will the IT specialist do to fix the problem?
	The IT specialist will replace the fuser because smudging print indicates that the toner is not fusing to the paper.
