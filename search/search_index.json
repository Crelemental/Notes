Rule-based access control,     allows access according to a set of ruled defined by the sysadmin.  Role-based access control,      RBAC, allows access based on the role of the individual being granted access.  Attribute-based access control, and      ABAC, based on the specific attributes of a person, resource, or environment.      Subject Attributes belong to an individual. IE something like CAPTCHAs.

They are expected to make difficult ethical decisions and to support one another in doing so. While the board recognizes its obligation to provide the certificate holder with guidance on making ethical decisions, it does not expect to supervise or judge professionals in making these difficult decisions. The board recognizes its responsibility to maintain the integrity of the certification. It accepts that, from time to time, the good of the profession may require it to disassociate the profession from egregious behavior on the part of a particular certificate holder. It intends to deal with necessary complaints in a timely manner. This document describes the procedure to be used when complaints are necessary. By publishing these procedures, the board does not expect, invite, solicit, or encourage such complaints. The use of these procedures is for the sole purpose of protecting the reputation of the profession. They are not intended to be used to coerce or punish certificate holders. Confidentiality     The board and its agents undertake to keep the identity of the complainant and respondent in any complaint confidential from the general public. While disclosure of the identity of the complainant will be avoided where possible, upon filing a complaint, the complainant implies consent to disclose his identity to the respondent, where the board or its agents deem it necessary for due process. Actions of the board may be published at its discretion. Parties are encouraged to maintain confidentiality and certificate holders are reminded of their obligation to protect the profession. Specificity of Complaints     The committee will consider only complaints that specify the canon of our ISC2 Code of Ethics that has been violated. If you are unsure of the canon violated, file the complaint to the best of your ability or contact the Ethics Committee contact listed at the end of these procedures. Professional Conduct Committee     The Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee is a standing committee to assist ISC2 in the review of allegations of ethical misconduct of ISC2 members. It is established to oversee the application of the ISC2 Code of Ethics as it relates to exam candidate eligibility, deliver recommendations concerning the enforcement of the ISC2 Code of Ethics, and periodically review and recommend revisions to the Code. Learn more about the\u00a0Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee. Standing of Complainant     Complaints will be accepted only from those who claim to be injured by the alleged behavior. While any member of the public may complain about a breach of Canons I or II, only principals (those with an employer/contractor relationship with the certificate holder) may complain about violations of Canons III, and only other professionals (those who are certified or licensed as a professional AND also subscribe to a code of ethics) may complain about violations of Canon IV. Form of Complaints     All complaints must be in writing. The committee is not an investigative body and does not have investigative resources. Only information submitted in writing will be considered. Two copies must be submitted. One in written form and the other in PDF.     Complaints must be in the form of a sworn affidavit. The committee will not consider allegations in any other form. -\u00a0Download an Ethics Complaint Affidavit Form     Complaints should be sufficiently complete to enable the board to reach an appropriate judgment. At a minimum, the affidavit should specify the respondent, the behavior complained of, the canon breached, the standing of the complainant, and any corroborating evidence. Neither the board nor its committee is an investigative body and neither has the authority to compel testimony. We can consider only evidence submitted to us voluntarily. There may be many cases where this evidence is not sufficient to support any action. We can proceed only where a prima facie case is made. Where no such case is made, the committee will close the complaint without prejudice to either party. Committee Procedures     Where a prima facie case has been made, the Ethics Committee will review and tender a recommendation to the board. Rights of Respondents     Respondents to complaints are entitled to timely notification of complaints. It is the intent of the board and its agents to notify the respondent within thirty days from receipt of the complaint. The respondent is entitled to see all complaints, evidence, and other documents. The respondent will have thirty days from accepting and acknowledging delivery to submit information in defense, explanation, rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation. As with the complaint, in order to be considered this information must be in the form of a sworn affidavit. As in the law, silence implies consent. That is, to the extent that the respondent is silent, the committee may assume that he does not dispute the allegations. The committee may grant necessary extensions of time to the respondent upon request. Disagreement on the Facts     Where there is disagreement between the parties over the facts alleged, the Ethics Committee, at its sole discretion, may invite additional corroboration, exculpation, rebuttals and sur-rebuttals in an attempt to resolve such dispute. The committee is not under any obligation to make a finding where the facts remain in dispute between the parties. Where the committee is not able to reach a conclusion on the facts, the benefit of all doubt goes to the respondent. That is to say, where the respondent disputes the facts alleged, then the burden of proof is on the complainant. Findings and Recommendations     The Ethics Committee will submit findings and recommendations for action to the board. In reaching its findings, the committee will consider any published guidance that has been given to certificate holders. In reaching its recommendations, the committee will prefer the most limited and conservative action consistent with its findings. Notification and Right of Comment     The Ethics Committee will notify the parties of its recommendation prior to any board action. Parties have 14 days submit a response or comments on the recommendations for consideration by the board. Disciplinary Action     Discipline of certificate holders is at the sole discretion of the board. Decisions of the board are final. Final Disposition     Parties will be notified of the final disposition within thirty days of board action.

Historically, an organization would install antivirus software on all its endpoints, such as workstations, servers and laptops, and the antivirus software would run in the background scanning files as they were accessed and processes as they were initiated. And enterprise grade antivirus solution would feed logs and alerts back to the main administrator console, which was monitored and may have automatic action rules set for things like allow, ignore quarantine or delete antivirus solutions had a terrible track record of causing major performance issues on endpoints like using inordinate amounts of RAM and constantly keeping the disk in use while it scanned in the background.\" -&gt; \"So today, modern enterprises deploy EDR software. EDR is like an entire toolkit versus a traditional antivirus single screwdriver. EDR integrates tightly with the endpoint OS, leveraging the built in protections using much fewer resources like RAM and Disk, which slowed down overall system performance in older antivirus and antimalware, and still feeds back to a local or cloud based admin console. But there are much more options and much more automated responses. EDR is usually cloud based or at least cloud aware. Getting updates in real time, as well as submitting threat samples to the vendor. Signature vials can change on the fly and are much smaller. Yes, you still have controls like allow, ignore, quarantine and delete, but you can also have advanced commands like isolate from the network or immediately alert the console and stop the user from working. In other words, the are in EDR response means you set pre-programmed rules or scripts based on the threat level that might be detected, and the vendor can artificially increase the response to a threat based on real time data. The vendor is seeing from other customers in other locations, also feeding the vendor data. Additionally, EDR is often touted as being an integral part of a SIEM SEM SIM solution or may plug seamlessly into other threat detection tools, such as an integrated firewall appliance at the edge of the network.\"     not solely signature based;

Its used with 128, 192, or 256 bit keys. Longer keys are harder to crack but require more computing to encrypt data. Its a symmetric algorithm like DES.

Thus, allowing a computer to encrypt its wireless network traffic using AES and transmit it with minimal effect on performance.</p> <p>WEP      Wired Equivalent Privacy, one of the first wireless standards proposed by IEEE in 1997.

WPA was a bridge between the WEP standard and more secure IEEE 802.11i standard.      WPA uses a variable length alphanumeric passphrase, which is 8-63 characters in length.     Utilizes TKIP, temporal key integrity protocol. TKIP gives WPA a significant security boost by generating a new 128bit key for every packet sent on the network.      Flaws have been found over time leading to new standards.</p> <p>WPA2     Biggest difference between WPA2 and WPA was the mandatory support for Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) (part of the AES standard now). It provided data confidentiality, authentication, and access control to the network.     Eventually had weaknesses that led to WPA3</p> <p>WPA3     It increased the minimum key strength to 192bit for enterprise mode connections, which are often used in organizations instead of the personal mode.      WPA3 eliminated the use of a passphrase or key that allowed computers to join a personal mode network. In WPA3, all devices use Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) method to exchange the network key. It ensures the initial key exchange in personal mode is more secure by eliminating the need to tell others the key before joining the network.     WPA3 also implements perfect forward secrecy (PFS) that ensures if a key is compromised, that that key only affects data exchanged in that encryption session only.     Another improvement is the encryption of management frames, such as de-associating from the network (De-auth attack exploit). </p> <p>Ad-Hoc     All wireless communication is performed in a peer-peer fashion and doesnt require a WAP.

Auth is done using username/password but also with PKI (public key infrastructure) certificates. ![[Pasted image 20240107141423.png]] It grants trusted network access by     1. Client requests access to network via WPA or wired ethernet switch and provides credentials.     2. The WAP or switch forward the request to a special authentication server running Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) or EAP, which then it validates the credentials and determines the user's auth based on policies defined by a network admin.     3. If the credentials are validated and the user is authorized, the WAP or switch grant network access to the user.     4. If the user is not authenticated properly or doesn't have the auth to access the network, the WAP or switch will block network access to the user. 802.1x can also check the version of AV or malware scanners on a computer, and if it's not to corporate standard, the network admin can configure a policy to limit network access, such as access to update the AV software.</p>"},{"location":"Network%20and%20Security%20Foundations/Network%20Security%20Operations/#wireless-attack-types","title":"Wireless attack types","text":"<p>De-auth Attack     DoS attack where the attacker can force any client off of the network.

A host can use a variety of methods to resolve a name or FQDN to an IP address. In very general terms, these will be as follows: 1. Check local cache. One complication here is that there are different types of cache and separate caches for individual applications, such as web browsers. On Windows, you can use\u00a0ipconfig /displaydns\u00a0and\u00a0ipconfig /flushdns\u00a0to monitor and clear the system cache. 2. Check HOSTS. The HOSTS file is a static list of host name to IP address mappings. The default location under Windows is\u00a0%SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\, while under Linux it is usually placed in the\u00a0/etc\u00a0directory. In most cases, HOSTS should not contain any entries (other than the loopback address). Any static entries in HOSTS could be the cause of a name resolution issue. The file can also be used for troubleshooting. 3. Query DNS.

VPNs depend on tunneling protocols. Tunneling is used when the source and destination hosts are on the same logical network but connected via different physical networks. The\u00a0Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\u00a0is an encapsulation protocol that works at the Data Link layer (Layer 2). PPP is used to encapsulate IP packets for transmission over serial digital lines.      PPP has no security mechanisms, so must be used with other protocols to provision a secure tunnel.     Where PPP works at Layer 2,\u00a0Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)\u00a0works at Layer 3. A GRE packet can itself encapsulate an IP packet (or most other network layer protocol types) as its payload. The \"outer\" GRE packet is assigned protocol number 47 and has its own IP source and header address fields. The GRE packet is then itself encapsulated in a Layer 2 frame for transmission to the next hop router. Each intermediate router inspects only the outer GRE header to determine the forwarding destination. At the final destination, the receiving router de-encapsulates the GRE packet to extract the inner IP payload and forwards that inner packet to its destination. GRE does not have any mechanisms for authenticating users or devices and so is often used with other protocols in a VPN solution.     Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) also operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model to encrypt packets passing over any network. IPSec is often used with other protocols to provide connection security, but is increasingly used as a native VPN protocol.     Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP or datagram TLS (DTLS) over UDP can be used to encapsulate frames or IP packets. The main drawback is that as TLS already operates at the session layer, the headers from the inner and outer packets add up to a significant overhead.</p> <p>Client-to-site is the \"telecommuter\" model, allowing home-workers and employees working in the field to connect to the corporate network.

For example, a hard drive may be described with an MTTF, while a server, which could be repaired by replacing the hard drive, would be described with an MTBF. The calculation for MTTF is the total operational time divided by the number of devices. For example, say two drives were installed in the server in a RAID array. One had failed after 10 years, but had never been replaced, and the second failed after 14 years, bringing down the array and the server. The MTTF of the drives is (10+14)/2 = 12 years. - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)\u00a0is a measure of the time taken to correct a fault so that the system is restored to full operation. This can also be described as mean time to replace or recover. MTTR is calculated as the total number of hours of unplanned maintenance divided by the number of failure incidents. This average value can be used to estimate whether a recovery time objective (RTO) is achievable.</p> <p>Site resiliency is described as hot, warm, or cold: - A\u00a0hot site\u00a0can failover almost immediately. It generally means that the site is already within the organization's ownership and is ready to deploy. For example, a hot site could consist of a building with operational computer equipment that is kept updated with a live data set. - A\u00a0warm site\u00a0could be similar, but with the requirement that the latest data set will need to be loaded. - A\u00a0cold site\u00a0takes longer to set up. A cold site may be an empty building with a lease agreement in place to install whatever equipment is required when necessary.</p> <p>Power Distribution Units The circuits supplying grid power to a rack, network closet, or server room must meet the load capacity of all the installed equipment (plus room for growth). Consequently, circuits to a server room will typically be higher capacity than domestic or office circuits (30 or 60 amps as opposed to 13 amps, for instance). These circuits may be run through a\u00a0power distribution unit (PDU). A PDU has circuitry to \"clean\" the power signal, provides protection against spikes, surges, and brownouts, and can integrate with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).</p>"},{"location":"Network%2B/Applied%20Networking/#high-availability","title":"High Availability","text":"<p>Multipathing\u00a0means that a network node has more than one physical link to another node. Multipathing is a default feature of full and partial mesh internetworks, where routers can select alternative paths through the network if a link is not available. Multipathing can be used anywhere that link redundancy is required. Two common additional scenarios are connections to storage area networks (SANs) and Internet access via an Internet Service Provider (ISP): - SAN multipathing-In a SAN, a server uses shared storage accessed over a network link. Multipathing means that the server has at least two SAN controllers each with a dedicated link to the storage network. - Multiple ISPs-If an organization depends on a single ISP for Internet access, that circuit represents a critical single point of failure. Even if there are multiple circuits to the same ISP, problems within that ISP's routing or DNS infrastructure could result in complete loss of connectivity. Contracting with multiple ISPs and using routing policies to forward traffic over multiple external circuits provides fault tolerance and load balancing. You need to ensure that the ISPs are operating separate infrastructure and not using peering arrangements.</p> <p>Link aggregation means combining two or more separate cabled links between a host and a switch into a single logical channel.

Layer 4 switch-Basic load balancers make forwarding decisions on IP address and TCP/UDP header values, working at the transport layer of the OSI model.     Layer 7 switch (content switch)-As web applications have become more complex, modern load balancers need to be able to make forwarding decisions based on application-level data, such as a request for a particular URL or data types like video or audio streaming.

Footprinting allows a threat actor to discover the topology and general configuration of the network and security systems. Footprinting can be done by social engineering attacks-persuading users to give information or locating information that has been thrown out as trash, for instance. Port scanning specifically aims to enumerate the TCP or UDP application ports on which a host will accept connections.     Fingerprinting allows a threat actor to identify device and OS types and versions. When a host running a particular operating system responds to a port scan, the syntax of the response might identify the specific operating system. This fact is also true of application servers, such as web servers, FTP servers, and mail servers. The responses these servers make often include headers or banners that can reveal a great deal of information about the server. A threat actor can use this information to probe for known vulnerabilities. Spoofing Attacks     The term\u00a0spoofing\u00a0covers a wide range of different attacks. Spoofing can include any type of attack where the attacker disguises his or her identity, or in which the source of network information is forged to appear legitimate. Social engineering and techniques such as phishing and pharming, where the attacker sets up a false website in imitation of a real one, are types of spoofing attacks. It is also possible to abuse the way a protocol works or how network packets are constructed to inject false or modified data onto a network. The ARP and DNS protocols are often used as vectors for this type of attack. Denial of Service Attacks     A\u00a0denial of service (DoS)\u00a0attack causes a service at a given host to fail or to become unavailable to legitimate users. Resource exhaustion DoS attacks focus on overloading a service by using up CPU, system RAM, disk space, or network bandwidth. It is also possible for DoS attacks to exploit design failures or other vulnerabilities in application software. A physical DoS attack might involve cutting telephone lines or network cabling or switching off the power to a server. DoS attacks may be motivated by the malicious desire to cause trouble. They may also be part of a wider attack, such as the precursor to a spoofing or data exfiltration attack. DoS can assist these attacks by diverting attention and resources away from the real target. For example, a blinding attack attempts to overload a logging or alerting system with events.</p>"},{"location":"Network%2B/Applied%20Networking/#on-path-attacks","title":"On-Path Attacks","text":"<p>MAC Spoofing and IP Spoofing     A host can arbitrarily select any MAC and/or IP address and attempt to use it on the network. A threat actor might exploit this to spoof the value of a valid MAC or IP address to try to circumvent an access control list or impersonate a legitimate server. For this type of attack to succeed, the threat actor must normally disable the legitimate host or there will be duplicate addresses on the network, which will have unpredictable results.     IP spoofing is also used in most denial of service (DoS) attacks to mask the origin of the attack and make it harder for the target system to block packets from the attacking system. In this type of spoofing, the threat actor does not care about not receiving return traffic. ARP Spoofing     ARP spoofing, or ARP cache poisoning, is a common means of perpetrating an on-path attack. It works by broadcasting unsolicited ARP reply packets, also known as gratuitous ARP replies, with a source address that spoofs a legitimate host or router interface. Because ARP has no security, all devices in the same broadcast domain as the rogue host trust this communication and update their MAC:IP address cache table with the spoofed address. Because the threat actor broadcasts endless ARP replies, it overwhelms the legitimate interface. Rogue DHCP     An on-path attack can also be launched by running a rogue DHCP server. DHCP communications cannot be authenticated, so a host will generally trust the first offer packet that it receives. The threat actor can exploit this to set his or her machine as the subnet's default gateway or DNS resolver.</p> <p>DNS poisoning\u00a0is an attack that compromises the name resolution process. Typically, the attacker will replace the valid IP address for a trusted website, such as mybank.example, with the attacker's IP address. The attacker can then intercept all the packets directed to mybank.example and bounce them to the real site, leaving the victim unaware of what is happening (referred to as pharming). Alternatively, DNS spoofing could be used for a DoS attack by directing all traffic for a particular FQDN to an invalid IP address (a black hole).</p> <p>VLAN hopping\u00a0is an attack designed to send traffic to a VLAN other than the one the host system is in. This exploits the native VLAN feature of 802.1Q. Native VLANs are designed to provide compatibility with non-VLAN capable switches. The attacker, using a device placed in the native VLAN, crafts a frame with two VLAN tag headers. The first trunk switch to inspect the frame strips the first header, and the frame gets forwarded to the target VLAN. Such an attack can only send packets one way but could be used to perform a DoS attack against a host on a different VLAN.</p>"},{"location":"Network%2B/Applied%20Networking/#wireless-attacks","title":"Wireless Attacks","text":"<p>Rogue Access Points     A\u00a0rogue access point\u00a0is one that has been installed on the network without authorization, whether with malicious intent or not.

Evil Twins     A rogue AP masquerading as a legitimate one is called an\u00a0evil twin. An evil twin might advertise a similar network name (SSID) to the legitimate one. For example, an evil twin might be configured with the network name \"compeny\" where the legitimate network name is \"company.\" Alternatively, the evil twin might spoof the SSID and BSSID (MAC address) of an authorized access point and then the attacker might use some DoS technique to overcome the legitimate AP. Deauthentication Attacks     The use of an evil twin may be coupled with a\u00a0deauthentication attack.

This reduces the attack surface of a network appliance or OS. Attack surface means the range of things that an attacker could possibly exploit in order to compromise the device. It is particularly important to disable unused administration interfaces.</li> <li>Disable unsecure protocols-Sniffing attacks can be mitigated by encrypting the channel over which communications takes place. This means that even if the eavesdropper can listen to the message, he or she cannot understand it without obtaining the encryption key. It is important to understand which protocols are unsecure in terms of using unencrypted channels. This is particularly important when using a channel to authenticate. Unsecure protocols should be deprecated, and secure protocols used instead. For example, the original versions of SNMP are unencrypted. To implement secure SNMP, either configure SNMPv3, which supports encryption, or use an encapsulation protocol such as IPSec to encrypt SNMP traffic.</li> </ul> <p>MAC Filtering and Dynamic ARP Inspection     Configuring\u00a0MAC filtering\u00a0on a switch means defining which MAC addresses are permitted to connect to a particular port. This can be done by creating a list of valid MAC addresses or by specifying a limit to the number of permitted addresses. For example, if port security is enabled with a maximum of two MAC addresses, the switch will record the first two MACs to connect to that port but then drop any traffic from machines with different network adapter IDs that try to connect.     A switch port security feature such as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) prevents a host attached to an untrusted port from flooding the segment with gratuitous ARP replies. ARP inspection maintains a trusted database of IP:ARP mappings. It also ensures that ARP packets are validly constructed and use valid IP addresses. DHCP Snooping     Configuring\u00a0DHCP snooping\u00a0causes the switch to inspect DHCP traffic arriving on access ports to ensure that a host is not trying to spoof its MAC address. It can also be used to prevent rogue DHCP servers from operating on the network. With DHCP snooping, only DHCP offers from ports configured as trusted are allowed. Port Security/IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control     MAC limiting and filtering and ARP inspection provide some protection against attacks, but they are not a means of ensuring only valid hosts are connecting to the network.\u00a0Port security\u00a0refers to the IEEE 802.1X standard\u2019s Port-Based Network Access Control (PNAC) mechanism.

This might be used by a hosting company to prevent web servers operated by different customers being able to communicate.</p> <p>WIRELESS SECURITY - Preshared keys (PSKs)-Group authentication allows stations to connect to the network using a shared passphrase, which is used to generate a preshared key (PSK). The passphrase should be sufficient length (14+ characters) to ensure a strong key. - Extensible Authentication Protocol-An access point can implement a similar port security mechanism to switches. This is configured on the access point by selecting enterprise authentication. This allows users to authenticate to the wireless network against a RADIUS server using their regular network credential. EAP also allows for device authentication using digital certificates. - Captive portal-A guest network might be configured to perform authentication by redirecting stations to a secure web page. The user must authenticate to the page and meet other administrator-set requirements, such as accepting a use policy, before the station is authorized to use the network. - MAC filtering-As with a switch, an access point can be configured with an accept or deny list of known MAC addresses. - Geofencing-Can be used to ensure that the station is within a valid geographic area to access the network, such as ensuring the device is within a building rather than trying to access the WLAN from a car park or other external location. - Antenna placement and power levels-Site designs and surveys facilitate robust wireless coverage when all expected areas receive a strong signal. Power levels and channel selection should be tuned so that access points do not interfere with one another or broadcast a signal that stations can \"hear\" but cannot reply to. The presence of an unusually strong transmitter (30 dBm+) might indicate the presence of an evil twin rogue access point. - Wireless client isolation-Clients connected to a WLAN are normally within the same broadcast domain and can communicate with one another. An access point can be configured to prevent this so that stations can only communicate via its gateway. Peer-to-peer traffic is dropped by the AP. - Guest network isolation-A guest network can have separate security and forwarding policies applied to it than the network that permits access to the corporate LAN. Typically, a guest network is permitted access to the Internet but not to local servers. Most SOHO routers come with a preconfigured guest network.

A jumper (bridging clip) is installed over the middle two terminals to complete the connection.</li> <li>The 110 block (developed by AT&amp;T) is a type of distribution frame supporting 100 MHz operation (Cat 5) and better. A 110 wiring block is arranged horizontally rather than vertically, offering better density than a 66 block. There is also more space for labeling the connectors and each column of connectors is color-coded, making management simpler. The incoming wire pairs are fed into channels on the wiring block, then a connector block or wafer is installed to terminate the incoming wiring. Outgoing wire pairs are then punched into the terminals on the connector blocks to complete the circuit.</li> <li>Where a 110 block uses a two-piece design where wafer blocks are installed over the main block, competing formats BIX and Krone use a single module. 110 blocks and BIX blocks (developed by Nortel) are common in North America, while some European vendors often prefer Krone. As well as the differences in block design, the IDCs are angled differently in each format, requiring a different termination blade to be used to ensure a reliable connection.</li> <li>In data networks, numerous moves, adds, and changes (MACs) would require reterminating the wiring. To simplify MACs, a\u00a0patch panel\u00a0or patch bay is a type of distribution block with IDCs on one side and pre-terminated RJ-45 modular ports on the other. This allows incoming and outgoing connections to be reconfigured by changing the patch cable connections, which is much simpler than reterminating punchdown blocks. The structured cabling (running from the work area or forming a backbone) is terminated at the back of the patch panel on the IDCs. An RJ-45 patch cord is used to connect the port to another network port, typically a switch port housed in the same rack. This greatly simplifies wiring connections and is the most commonly installed type of wiring distribution where connections need to be changed often.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Network%2B/Connections%20and%20Addressing/#tools","title":"Tools","text":"<p>Fixed cable is terminated using a\u00a0punchdown tool.

QSFP/QSFP+     Quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP)\u00a0is a transceiver form factor that supports 4 x 1 Gbps links, typically aggregaed to a single 4 Gbps channel. Enhanced quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP+) is designed to support 40 GbE by provisioning 4 x 10 Gbps links. QSFP+ is typically used with parallel fiber and multi-fiber push-on (MPO) termination. An MPO backbone ribbon cable bundles 12 or more strands with a single compact terminator (the cables are all manufactured and cannot be field terminated). When used with QSFP+, four strands transmit a full-duplex 40 Gbps link, four strands receive, and the other four strands are unused.  BiDirectional Wavelength Division Multiplexing     Bidirectional (BiDi) transceivers support transmit and receive signals over the same strand of fiber. This uses WDM to transmit the Tx and Rx signals over slightly shifted wavelengths, such as 1310 nm for Tx and 1490\u00a0nm for Rx. BiDi transceivers must be installed in opposite pairs, so the downstream transceiver would have to use 1490 nm for Tx and 1310 for Rx.\u00a0Bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)\u00a0links are documented in Ethernet standards (1000BASE-BX and 10GBASE-BX). Coarse and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing     Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)\u00a0supports up to 16 wavelengths and is typically used to deploy four or eight bidirectional channels over a single fiber strand. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) provisions greater numbers of channels (20, 40, 80, or 160). This means that there is much less spacing between each channel and requires more precise and expensive lasers. CWDM and DWDM transceivers support multi-channel 1 G, 10 G, and 40 G Ethernet links.

Organizations can use locally administered addresses rather than universal coding systems. This is defined by changing the U/L bit from 0 to 1. The rest is configured using the card driver or network management software.      Broadcast Address. The I/G bit of a MAC address determines whether the frame is addressed to an individual node (0) or a group (1). The latter is used for broadcast and multicast transmissions.

On corporate networks, switches are most likely managed, meaning switch settings can be configured.  Stackable     Switches that can be connected together and operate as a group, with the stack being managed as a single unit. Modular vs fixed.      Fixed switch comes with a set number of ports and cannot be changed or upgraded, while a modular switch has slots for plug-in cards, meaning they can be configured with different numbers and types of ports. Desktop vs rack mounted     Simple unmanaged switches with 5-8 ports might be small freestanding units that can be placed on a desktop. Larger switches are designed to be fitted to the standard size racks that hold networking equipment.</p> <p>Switch interface configuration     Configuration of a managed switch can be performed at a CLI, allowing changes like command modes or hierarchies.      {show config} displays the switch's configuration (with startup config being different from running config).     {show interface} lists the state of all interfaces or the specified interface, identified by type, slot, and port number. </p> <p>Most switch interfaces are configured to use\u00a0auto-MDI/MDIX\u00a0by default.

That address is cached in a MAC address table, implemented as a content addressable memory (CAM). If the MAC address cannot be found in there, the switch will act like a hub and flood all ports except source port. You can also query the MAC address table to find the addresses associated with ports.</p> <p>Port security configuration validates the MAC address of end systems that connect to a switch port. Unknown or frequently changing host MAC addresses might indicate an intrusion attempt. Port security configs have 2 elements: Specify a static MAC address or allow the port to learn and accept a certain number of sticky addresses. Specify an enforcement action when a policy violation is detected (ie alert only or shutdown port).</p> <p>Port aggregation means combining two or more cabled links into a single logical channel.

It can test and report cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, etc...      It might incorporate the function of a time domain reflectometer (TDR). Its used to measure the length of a cable run and can locate open and short circuits, sharp bends, and other imperfections causing performance loss. It transmits a short signal pulse of known amp and duration down a cable and measures the corresponding amp and time delay with the resultant signal reflections.</p> <p>You can use a multimeter to check physical connectivity in a copper cable, knowing the respective resistance.

Usually indicates a problem with bad wiring, a bad connector, or improper termination. Various types of crosstalk can be measured:     Near End (NEXT)- measures crosstalk on the receive pairs at the transmitter end, cause by excessive untwisting of pairs or faulty bonding of shielding.     Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Near End (ACRN)- The difference between insertion loss and NEXT. Equivalent to SNR. High value means signal is stronger than noise, with closer to 0 being high error rates.     Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Far End (ACRF)- Far end crosstalk (FEXT) is measured on the receive pairs at the recipient end. Difference between insertion loss and FEXT, measures cable performance regardless of link length     Power sum- Gigabit and 10GbE use all 4 pairs.

There are two main formats for patch cords:     Straight through-the cable is terminated with either T568A at both ends or T568B at both ends. This type of cable is used for an uplink (MDI port to MDIX port). In fact, crossover cable is no longer required for this type of application, as switches either have an uplink port for this purpose or can autodetect and select between\u00a0a crossover\u00a0and straight-through connection. This is referred to as auto-MDI/MDI-X. All Gigabit Ethernet ports support auto-MDI/MDI-X.</p> <p>Rollover Cable/Console Cable A console cable is used to connect a PC or laptop to the command line terminal of a switch or router. The console port connection on the appliance is a standard RJ-45 jack (but wired in a different way to Ethernet). A program such as PuTTY on the PC is used to establish the connection using the appropriate settings for the serial link.</p> <p>Fiber Optic Cable Testing Breaks can be found using a optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). It sends light pulses down the cable and times how long it takes for any reflections to bounce back from the break. An optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) is used with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to ensure each channel has sufficient power. OSA can determine whether existing cable is suitable for reuse with WDM and which wavelengths support the link distance required.  Dirty optical cables can cause a great reduction in signal strength or block transmission, usually found at the connecting end. It can be cleaned using solvent designed for fiber optic.

Address autoconfiguration     Prefix discovery - enables a host to discover the known network prefixes that have been allocated to the local segment. This facilitates next-hop determination. Prefix discovery uses router solicitation (RS) and router advertisement (RA) messages. An RA contains information about the network prefixes served by the router, information about autconfig options, plus information about link parameters (like MTU and hop limit).     Local address resolution - allows a host to discover other nodes and routers on the local network.     Redirection</p> <p>IPv6 uses a more flexible system of address autoconfiguration called\u00a0stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC): - The host generates a link local address and tests that it is unique by using the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. - The host listens for a router advertisement (RA) or transmits a router solicitation (RS) using ND protocol messaging. The router can either provide a network prefix, direct the host to a DHCPv6 server to perform stateful autoconfiguration, or perform some combination of stateless and stateful configuration.</p> <p>IPv6 uses an updated version of ICMP. The key new features are: - Error messaging-ICMPv6 supports the same sort of destination unreachable and time exceeded messaging as ICMPv4. One change is the introduction of a Packet Too Big class of error. Under IPv6, routers are no longer responsible for packet fragmentation and reassembly, so the host must ensure that they fit in the MTUs of the various links used. - Informational messaging-ICMPv6 supports ICMPv4 functions, such as echo and redirect, plus a whole new class of messages designed to support\u00a0Neighbor Discovery (ND)\u00a0and\u00a0Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD),\u00a0such as router and neighbor advertisements and solicitations.</p> <p>Dual stack hosts and routers can run both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously and communicate with devices configured with either type of address. Most modern desktop and server operating systems implement dual stack IP.</p> <p>As an alternative to dual stack,\u00a0tunneling can be used to deliver IPv6 packets across an IPv4 network. Tunneling means that IPv6 packets are inserted into IPv4 packets and routed over the IPv4 network to their destination. Routing decisions are based on the IPv4 address until the packets approach their destinations, at which point the IPv6 packets are stripped from their IPv4 carrier packets and forwarded according to IPv6 routing rules.

The SDN must be loop-free so that spanning tree protocol is not required, instead utilizing a protocol called Equal Cost Multipathing (ECMP) to distribute traffic between the links to the top-tier switches. Most importantly, all server resources will be on-premises, so the solution should avoid the use of the public Internet and the use of Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols, instead establishing private links with guaranteed service levels to operate as an overlay network and configure point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links between nodes without respect to the underlying physical and data link topologies (in other words, tunneling through the network layer). The SDN must also feature multipath redundancy to allow for load balancing and failover. Choose a multipath routing protocol that will best fulfill these requirements.     Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) can be used together for private links, using SPB and IS-IS (a link-state IGP that uses shortest-path-first algorithm to determine routes) as a link-layer overlay and MPLS as a link-layer-independent \"Layer 2.5\" underlay.</p> <p>NIST Special Publication 800-63B establishes a 14 character minimum password length for critical infrastructure such as switches.

A unique objective identifier (OID) identifies a variable that can be read or set using the SNMP protocol. The management information base (MIB) is a translation file that is used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID). A trap is an asynchronous notification from the agent to the manager. A trap is sent by the agent to notify the management of a significant event that is occurring in real-time, such as an alarming condition. A granular trap contains a unique object identifier (OID) number and a value for that OID. A verbose trap may contain all the information about a given alert or event as its payload. A verbose trap contains more information and data than a granular trap, and therefore requires more bandwidth to send the verbose trap over the network.</p> <p>The network administrator is troubleshooting the switchports for a file server with dual NICs. The file server needs to be configured for redundancy, and the dual NICs need to be combined for maximum throughput. What feature on the switch should the network administrator ensure is enabled for best results?     OBJ-2.3: The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is the 802.3ad protocol is used to group numerous physical ports to make one high bandwidth path. This method can increase bandwidth and therefore, throughput. LACP can also provide network redundancy and load balancing. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them. STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1d standard. A Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) is used by STP to prevent the bridge loops. Load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources, with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.</p> <p>Your network relies on the use of ATM cells. At which layer of the OSI model do ATM cells operate?     OBJ-1.1: In the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model, the basic unit of transfer is called a frame. In an ATM network, though, these frames are called cells and are of a fixed (53 octets or bytes) length that allows for faster switching of the cells across the network.</p> <p>Max is a network technician who just terminated the ends on a new copper cable used between two legacy switches. When he connects the two switches using the cable, they fail to establish a connection. What is MOST likely the issue?`     OBJ-2.3: There are two types of cable, Straight-through and Crossover. In this instance, a crossover cable would need to be used to communicate with legacy switches since they won't support MDIX. A medium dependent interface crossover (MDIX) is a version of the medium dependent interface (MDI) enabling a connection between corresponding devices, such as a switch to another switch. If the switch doesn't MDIX, then you must use a crossover cable to connect them. Bend radius cannot be the correct answer to this question since copper cables are being used and not fiber cables. Bend radius is a concern when using fiber cables as it leads to increase reflections and a decrease in signal strength. An RJ-11 connector only has 6 pins and is smaller than an RJ-45 connector. The technician would visually be able to see the difference as the RJ-11 connector would not fit properly in the switchports.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Incidents%20and%20Investigations/","title":"Incidents and Investigations","text":""},{"location":"Security%2B/Incidents%20and%20Investigations/#lesson-17","title":"Lesson 17","text":"<p>The following are the principal stages in an incident response life cycle: 1. Preparation\u2014make the system resilient to attack in the first place. This includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and setting up confidential lines of communication. It also implies creating incident response resources and procedures. 2. Identification\u2014from the information in an alert or report, determine whether an incident has taken place, assess how severe it might be (triage), and notify stakeholders. 3. Containment\u2014limit the scope and magnitude of the incident. The principal aim of incident response is to secure data while limiting the immediate impact on customers and business partners. 4. Eradication\u2014once the incident is contained, remove the cause and restore the affected system to a secure state by wiping a system and applying secure configuration settings. 5. Recovery\u2014with the cause of the incident eradicated, the system can be reintegrated into the business process that it supports. Applying patches and updates to a system to help prevent future incidents is important as well. This recovery phase may involve restoration of data from backup and security testing. Systems must be monitored more closely for a period to detect and prevent any reoccurrence of the attack. The response process may have to iterate through multiple phases of identification, containment, eradication, and recovery to effect a complete resolution. 6. Lessons learned\u2014analyze the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident. The outputs from this phase feed back into a new preparation phase in the cycle.</p> <p>An\u00a0incident response plan (IRP)\u00a0lists the procedures, contacts, and resources available to responders for various incident categories. The CSIRT should develop profiles or scenarios of typical incidents (DDoS attack, virus/worm outbreak, data exfiltration by an external adversary, data modification by an internal adversary, and so on). This will guide investigators in determining priorities and remediation plans. A\u00a0playbook\u00a0(or runbook) is a data-driven standard operating procedure (SOP) to assist junior analysts in detecting and responding to specific cyberthreat scenarios, such as phishing attempts, SQL injection data exfiltration, connection to a block-listed IP range, and so on. The playbook starts with a SIEM report and query designed to detect the incident and identify the key detection, containment, and eradication steps to take.</p> <p>Threat research provides insight into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Insights from threat research can be used to develop specific tools and playbooks to deal with event scenarios. These stages are often referred to as a cyber\u00a0kill chain, following the influential white paper Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense commissioned by Lockheed Martin</p> <p>MITRE Corporation's\u00a0Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&amp;CK)\u00a0matrices provide access to a database of known TTPs. This freely available resource (attack.mitre.org) tags each technique with a unique ID and places it in one or more tactic categories, such as initial access, persistence, lateral movement, or command and control.</p> <p>The\u00a0Diamond Model\u00a0of Intrusion Analysis suggests a framework to analyze an intrusion event (E) by exploring the relationships between four core features: adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim.![[Pasted image 20240220101824.png]]</p> <p>You should distinguish specific incident response planning from other types of planning for disaster recovery and business continuity: - Disaster recovery plan\u2014a\u00a0disaster can be seen as a special class of incident where the organization's primary business function is disrupted. Disaster recovery requires considerable resources, such as shifting processing to a secondary site. Disaster recovery will involve a wider range of stakeholders than less serious incidents. - Business continuity plan (BCP)\u2014this identifies how business processes should deal with both minor and disaster-level disruption. During an incident, a system may need to be isolated. Continuity planning ensures that there is processing redundancy supporting the workflow, so that when a server is taken\u00a0offline for security remediation, processing can failover to a separate system. If systems do not have this sort of planned resilience, incident response will be much more disruptive. - Continuity of Operation Planning (COOP)\u2014this terminology is used for government facilities, but is functionally similar to business continuity planning. In some definitions, COOP refers specifically to backup methods of performing mission functions without IT support.</p> <p>Correlation\u00a0means interpreting the relationship between individual data points to diagnose incidents of significance to the security team. A SIEM correlation rule is a statement that matches certain conditions. These rules use logical expressions, such as AND and OR, and operators, such as\u00a0==\u00a0(matches),\u00a0&lt;\u00a0(less than),\u00a0&gt;\u00a0(greater than), and\u00a0in\u00a0(contains). For example, a single-user logon failure is not a condition that should raise an alert. Multiple user logon failures for the same account, taking place within the space of one hour, is more likely to require investigation and is a candidate for detection by a correlation rule.</p> <p>A SIEM can enact a retention policy so that historical log and network traffic data is kept for a defined period. This allows for retrospective incident and threat hunting, and can be a valuable source of forensic evidence.</p> <p>A sensor is a network tap or port mirror that performs packet capture and intrusion detection. One of the key uses of a SIEM is to aggregate data from multiple sensors and log sources, but it might also be appropriate to configure dashboards that show output from a single sensor or source host.</p> <p>Automation is the action of scripting a single activity, while orchestration is the action of coordinating multiple automations (and possibly manual activity) to perform a complex, multistep task. In the case of\u00a0security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), this task is principally incident response, though the technologies can be used for tasks such as threat hunting too. SOAR is designed as a solution to the problem of the volume of alerts overwhelming analysts' ability to respond, measured as the mean time to respond (MTTR).</p> <p>The basis of SOAR is to scan the organization's store of security and threat intelligence, analyze it using machine/deep learning techniques, and then use that data to automate and provide data enrichment for the workflows that drive incident response and threat hunting. It can also assist with provisioning tasks, such as creating and deleting user accounts, making shares available, or launching VMs from templates, to try to eliminate configuration errors. The SOAR will use technologies such as cloud and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)/Software-Defined Visibility (SDV) APIs, orchestration tools, and cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) feeds to integrate the different systems that it is managing. It will also leverage technologies such as automated malware signature creation and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to detect threats.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Incidents%20and%20Investigations/#lesson-18","title":"Lesson 18","text":"<p>Digital\u00a0forensics\u00a0is the practice of collecting evidence from computer systems to a standard that will be accepted in a court of law. Forensics investigations are most likely to be launched against crimes arising from insider threats, notably fraud or misuse of equipment (to download or store obscene material, for instance).</p> <p>E-discovery\u00a0is a means of filtering the relevant evidence produced from all the data gathered by a forensic examination and storing it in a database in a format such that it can be used as evidence in a trial. E-discovery software tools have been produced to assist this process. Some of the functions of e-discovery suites are: - Identify and deduplicate files and metadata\u2014many files on a computer system are \"standard\" installed files or copies of the same file. E-discovery filters these types of files, reducing the volume of data that must be analyzed. - Search\u2014allow investigators to locate files of interest to the case. As well as keyword search, software might support semantic search. Semantic search matches keywords if they correspond to a particular context. - Tags\u2014apply standardized keywords or labels to files and metadata to help organize the evidence. Tags might be used to indicate relevancy to the case or part of the case or to show confidentiality, for instance. - Security\u2014at all points evidence must be shown to have been stored, transmitted, and analyzed without tampering. - Disclosure\u2014an important part of trial procedure is that the same evidence be made available to both plaintiff and defendant. E-discovery can fulfill this requirement. Recent court cases have required parties to a court case to provide searchable ESI rather than paper records.</p> <p>The general principle is to capture evidence in the\u00a0order of volatility, from more volatile to less volatile. The ISOC best practice guide to evidence collection and archiving, published as\u00a0tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3227, sets out the general order as follows: 1. CPU registers and cache memory (including cache on disk controllers, GPUs, and so on). 2. Contents of nonpersistent system memory (RAM), including routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics. 3. Data on persistent mass storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, and flash memory devices):     - Partition and file system blocks, slack space, and free space.     - System memory caches, such as swap space/virtual memory and hibernation files.     - Temporary file caches, such as the browser cache.     - User, application, and OS files and directories. 1. Remote logging and monitoring data. 2. Physical configuration and network topology. 3.

For example, the Windows\u00a0Alternate Data Streams (ADS)\u00a0feature is often used to conceal file data, and various caches, such as prefetch and Amcache, can be used to find indicators of suspicious process behavior. Data recovery refers to analyzing a disk (or image of a disk) for file fragments stored in slack space. These fragments might represent deleted or overwritten files.

Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented: - Technical\u2014the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls. - Operational\u2014the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls. - Managerial\u2014the control gives oversight of the information system.

ISO 31K establishes best practices for performing risk assessments.</p> <p>Within SSAE No. 18 (the current specification), there are several levels of reporting: - Service Organization Control (SOC2)\u2014evaluates the internal controls implemented by the service provider to ensure compliance with Trust Services Criteria (TSC) when storing and processing customer data. TSC refers to security, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy properties. A SOC2 Type I report assesses the system design, while a Type II report assesses the ongoing effectiveness of the security architecture over a period of 6-12 months. SOC2 reports are highly detailed and designed to be restricted. They should only be shared with the auditor and regulators, and with important partners under non-disclosure agreement (NDA) terms. - SOC3\u2014a less detailed report certifying compliance with SOC2. SOC3 reports can be freely distributed.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the\u00a0Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)\u00a0mandates the implementation of risk assessments, internal controls, and audit procedures.

Effective risk management must focus on mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed. Part of this process involves identifying critical systems and assets that support these functions. 2.

Identify threats\u2014for each function or workflow, identify the threat sources and actors that may take advantage of or exploit or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities. 4. Analyze business impacts\u2014the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat and the impact of that incident on critical systems are the factors used to assess risk. There are quantitative and qualitative methods of analyzing impacts and likelihood. 5.

Most risks require some sort of mitigation, but other types of response might be more appropriate for certain types and level of risks.</p> <p>For each business process and each threat, you must assess the degree of risk that exists. Calculating risk is complex, but the two main variables are likelihood and impact: - Likelihood\u00a0of occurrence is the probability of the threat being realized. - Impact\u00a0is the severity of the risk if realized as a security incident. This may be determined by factors such as the value of the asset or the cost of disruption if the asset is compromised.</p> <p>Quantitative risk assessment aims to assign concrete values to each risk factor. - Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)\u2014the amount that would be lost in a single occurrence of the risk factor.

Bob compares Alice's digest to the hash value he has on file.

The secret key is so-called because it must be kept secret. If the key is lost or stolen, the security is breached.\u00a0Symmetric encryption\u00a0is used for confidentiality. For example, Alice and Bob can share a confidential file in the following way: 1. Alice and Bob meet to agree which cipher to use and a secret key value. They both record the value of the secret key, making sure that no one else can discover it. 2. Alice encrypts a file using the cipher and key. 3. She sends only the ciphertext to Bob over the network. 4. Bob receives the ciphertext and is able to decrypt it by applying the same cipher with his copy of the secret key.     In a\u00a0stream cipher, each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time. This is suitable for encrypting communications where the total length of the message is not known. The plaintext is combined with a separate randomly generated message, calculated from the key and an initialization vector (IV). The IV ensures the key produces a unique ciphertext from the same plaintext. The keystream must be unique, so an IV must not be reused with the same key. The recipient must be able to generate the same keystream as the sender and the streams must be synchronized. Stream ciphers might use markers to allow for synchronization and retransmission. Some types of stream ciphers are made self-synchronizing.     In a block cipher, the plaintext is divided into equal-size blocks (usually 128-bit). If there is not enough data in the plaintext, it is padded to the correct size using some string defined in the algorithm. For example, a 1200-bit plaintext would be padded with an extra 80 bits to fit into 10 x 128-bit blocks. Each block is then subjected to complex transposition and substitution operations, based on the value of the key used.     AES</p> <p>With an asymmetric cipher, operations are performed by two different but related public and\u00a0private keys\u00a0in a key pair.\u00a0 Each key is capable of reversing the operation of its pair. For example, if the public key is used to encrypt a message, only the paired private key can decrypt the ciphertext produced. The\u00a0public key\u00a0cannot be used to decrypt the ciphertext, even though it was used to encrypt it. Consequently, asymmetric encryption is mostly used for authentication and non-repudiation and for key agreement and exchange. Key agreement/exchange refers to settling on a secret symmetric key to use for bulk encryption without anyone else discovering it.     Many public key cryptography products are based on the\u00a0RSA algorithm.     Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)\u00a0is another type of trapdoor function that can be used in public key cryptography ciphers. The principal advantage of ECC over RSA's algorithm is that there are no known \"shortcuts\" to cracking the cipher or the math that underpins it, regardless of key length.</p> <p>Public key cryptography and hashing combined can be used to make a digital signature, to prove integrity and authentication. 1. Alice (the sender) creates a digest of a message, using a pre-agreed hash algorithm, and encrypts the digest using Alice\u2019s private key. This creates Alice\u2019s digital signature. 2. Alice attaches the digital signature and sends both the message and public key to Bob (the receiver). 3. Bob decrypts the digital signature using Alice's public key, resulting in the digest of the message. 4. Bob then creates a digest of the message, using the same pre-agreed hash algorithm that Alice used. Bob compares both digests. The\u00a0Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)\u00a0is a slightly different format for achieving the same sort of goal. DSA uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) rather than the RSA cipher.</p> <p>Therefore, both are used within the same product in a type of\u00a0key exchange\u00a0system known as a digital envelope or hybrid encryption. A digital envelope allows the sender and recipient to exchange a symmetric encryption key securely by using public key cryptography</p> <p>The question then arises of how anyone can trust the identity of the person or server issuing a public key. One solution is to have a third party, referred to as a\u00a0certificate authority (CA),\u00a0validate the owner of the public key by issuing the subject with a certificate. The certificate is signed by the CA. If the recipient also trusts the CA, they can also trust the public key wrapped in the subject's certificate. The process of issuing and verifying certificates is called\u00a0public key infrastructure (PKI).</p> <p>This risk from RSA key exchange is mitigated by\u00a0perfect forward secrecy (PFS). PFS uses\u00a0Diffie-Hellman (DH)\u00a0key agreement to create\u00a0ephemeral\u00a0session keys without using the server's private key. Diffie-Hellman allows Alice and Bob to derive the same shared secret just by agreeing some values that are all related by some trapdoor function.</p> <p>The final part of a cipher suite determines the bulk encryption cipher. When AES is selected as the symmetric cipher, it has to be used in a\u00a0mode of operation\u00a0that supports a stream of network data.     The\u00a0Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)\u00a0mode applies an initialization vector (IV) to the first plaintext block to ensure that the key produces a unique ciphertext from any given plaintext. The output of the first ciphertext block is then combined with the next plaintext block using an\u00a0XOR\u00a0operation. This process is repeated through the full \"chain\" of blocks, which (again) ensures that no plaintext block produces the same ciphertext. CBC needs to use padding to ensure that the data to encrypt is an exact multiple of the block size.     Counter mode (CTM)\u00a0makes the AES algorithm work as a stream cipher. Counter mode applies an IV plus an incrementing counter value to the key to generate a keystream. The keystream is then XOR'ed to the data in the plaintext blocks. Each block can be processed individually and consequently in parallel, improving performance. Also, counter modes do not need to use padding. Any unused space in the last block is simply discarded.</p> <p>A\u00a0message authentication code (MAC)\u00a0provides an authentication and integrity mechanism by hashing a combination of the message output and a shared secret key. The recipient can perform the same process using his or her copy of the secret key to verify the data. This type of authenticated encryption scheme is specified in a cipher suite as separate functions, such as \"AES CBC with HMAC-SHA.\" Unfortunately, the implementation of this type of authenticated mode in AES CBC is vulnerable to a type of cryptographic attack called a padding oracle attack (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/vulnerabilities-cbc-mode).</p> <p>The weaknesses of CBC arising from the padding mechanism means that stream ciphers or counter modes are strongly preferred. These use Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) modes of operation. In an AEAD scheme, the associated data allows the receiver to use the message header to ensure the payload has not been replayed from a different communication stream.</p> <p>An AEAD mode is identified by a single hyphenated function name, such as AES-GCM or AES-CCM. The ChaCha20-Poly1305 stream cipher has been developed as an alternative to AES.</p> <p>Obfuscation\u00a0is the art of making a message difficult to understand. Obfuscated source code is rewritten in a way that does not affect the way the computer compiles or executes the code, but makes it difficult for a person reading the code to understand how it works.</p> <p>Often, it is necessary to use an additional random or pseudo-random value in conjunction with the cipher: - Nonce\u2014the principal characteristic of a nonce is that it is never reused (\"number used once\") within the same scope (that is, with the same key value). It could be a random or pseudo-random value, or it could be a counter value. - Initialization vector (IV)\u2014the principal characteristic of an IV is that it is\u00a0random (or pseudo-random). There may also be a requirement that an IV not be reused (as with a nonce), but this is not the primary characteristic. - Salt\u2014this is also a random or pseudo-random number or string. The term\u00a0salt\u00a0is used specifically in conjunction with hashing password values.</p> <p>A\u00a0downgrade attack\u00a0can be used to facilitate a man-in-the-middle attack by requesting that the server use a lower specification protocol with weaker ciphers and key lengths. For example, rather than use TLS 1.3, as the server might prefer, the client requests the use of SSL. It then becomes easier for Mallory to forge the signature of a certificate authority that Alice trusts and have Alice trust Mallory's public key.</p> <p>A\u00a0birthday attack\u00a0is a type of brute force attack aimed at exploiting collisions in hash functions. A\u00a0collision\u00a0is where a function produces the same hash value for two different plaintexts. This type of attack can be used for the purpose of forging a digital signature. The attack works as follows: 1. The attacker creates a malicious document and a benign document that produce the same hash value. The attacker submits the benign document for signing by the target. 2. The attacker then removes the signature from the benign document and adds it to the malicious document, forging the target's signature. The trick here is being able to create a malicious document that outputs the same hash as the benign document. The birthday paradox means that the computational time required to do this is less than might be expected. The birthday paradox asks how large must a group of people be so that the chance of two of them sharing a birthday is 50%.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Information/#lesson-6","title":"Lesson 6","text":"<p>CAs must maintain a\u00a0certificate\u00a0revocation list (CRL)\u00a0of all revoked and suspended certificates, which can be distributed throughout the hierarchy.</p> <p>A CRL has the following attributes: - Publish period\u2014the date and time on which the CRL is published.

The preferred system for network authentication is based on Kerberos, but legacy network applications might use\u00a0NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.</p> <p>A\u00a0single sign-on (SSO)\u00a0system allows the user to authenticate once to a local device and be authenticated to compatible application servers without having to enter credentials again. In Windows, SSO is provided by the Kerberos framework.</p> <p>Kerberos\u00a0is a single sign-on network authentication and authorization protocol used on many networks, notably as implemented by Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) service. Kerberos was named after the three-headed guard dog of Hades (Cerberus) because it consists of three parts. Clients request services from application servers, which both rely on an intermediary\u2014a\u00a0Key Distribution Center (KDC)\u2014to vouch for their identity. There are two services that make up a KDC: the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service. The KDC runs on port 88 using TCP or UDP.</p> <p>The\u00a0Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)\u00a0is an unsophisticated authentication method developed as part of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), used to transfer TCP/IP data over serial or dial-up connections. It is also used as the basic authentication mechanism in HTTP. It relies on clear text password exchange and is therefore obsolete for most purposes, except through an encrypted tunnel.</p> <p>The\u00a0Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)\u00a0was also developed as part of PPP as a means of authenticating users over a remote link. CHAP relies on an encrypted challenge in a system called a\u00a0three-way handshake. 1. Challenge\u2014the server challenges the client, sending a randomly generated challenge message. 2. Response\u2014the client responds with a hash calculated from the server challenge message and client password (or other shared secret). 3. Verification\u2014the server performs its own hash using the password hash stored for the client. If it matches the response, then access is granted; otherwise, the connection is dropped. The handshake is repeated with a different challenge message periodically during the connection (although transparent to the user). This guards against\u00a0replay attacks,\u00a0in which a previous session could be captured and reused to gain access.</p> <p>The\u00a0Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)\u00a0is an industry body established with the aim of developing an open, strong authentication framework.\u00a0Open\u00a0means a system that any enterprise can link into to perform authentication of users and devices across different networks.\u00a0Strong\u00a0means that the system is based not just on passwords, but also on 2- or 3-factor authentication or on 2-step verification. OATH has developed two algorithms for implementing one time passwords (OTPs).</p> <p>HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP)\u00a0is an algorithm for token-based authentication (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.html). The authentication server and client token are configured with the same shared secret. This should be an 8-byte value generated by a cryptographically strong random number generator. The token could be a fob-type device or implemented as a smartphone authentication/authenticator app. The shared secret can be transmitted to the smartphone app as a QR code image acquirable by the phone's camera so that the user doesn't have to type anything. Obviously, it is important that no other device is able to acquire the shared secret. The shared secret is combined with a counter to create a one-time password when the user wants to authenticate. The device and server both compute the hash and derive an HOTP value that is 6-8 digits long. This is the value that the user must enter to authenticate with the server. The counter is incremented by one.</p> <p>The\u00a0Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP)\u00a0is a refinement of the HOTP (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238). One issue with HOTP is that tokens can be allowed to persist unexpired, raising the risk that an attacker might be able to obtain one and decrypt data in the future. In TOTP, the HMAC is built from the shared secret plus a value derived from the device's and server's local timestamps. TOTP automatically expires each token after a short window (60 seconds, for instance). For this to work, the client device and server must be closely time-synchronized. One well-known implementation of HOTP and TOTP is Google Authenticator.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Information/#lesson-8","title":"Lesson 8","text":"<p>Discretionary access control (DAC)\u00a0is based on the primacy of the resource owner. The owner is originally the creator of a file or service, though ownership can be assigned to another user. The owner is granted full control over the resource, meaning that he or she can modify its access control list (ACL) to grant rights to others. DAC is the most flexible model and is currently implemented widely in terms of computer and network security. In terms of file system security, it is the model used by default for most UNIX/Linux distributions and by Microsoft Windows. As the most flexible model, it is also the weakest because it makes centralized administration of security policies the most difficult to enforce. It is also the easiest to compromise, as it is vulnerable to insider threats and abuse of compromised accounts.</p> <p>Role-based access control (RBAC)\u00a0adds an extra degree of centralized control to the DAC model. Under RBAC, a set of organizational roles are defined, and subjects allocated to those roles. Under this system, the right to modify roles is reserved to a system owner. Therefore, the system is non-discretionary, as each subject account has no right to modify the ACL of a resource, even though they may be able to change the resource in other ways. Users are said to gain rights implicitly (through being assigned to a role) rather than explicitly (being assigned the right directly). RBAC can be partially implemented through the use of security group accounts, but they are not identical schemes. Membership of security groups is largely discretionary (assigned by administrators, rather than determined by the system). Also, ideally, a subject should only inherit the permissions of a role to complete a particular task rather than retain them permanently.</p> <p>Mandatory access control (MAC)\u00a0is based on the idea of security clearance levels. Rather than defining ACLs on resources, each object and each subject is granted a clearance level, referred to as a label. If the model used is a hierarchical one (that is, high clearance users are trusted to access low clearance objects), subjects are only permitted to access objects at their own clearance level or below. The labelling of objects and subjects takes place using pre-established rules. The critical point is that these rules cannot be changed by any subject account, and are therefore non-discretionary. Also, a subject is not permitted to change an object's label or to change his or her own label.</p> <p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC)\u00a0is the most fine-grained type of access control model. As the name suggests, an ABAC system is capable of making access decisions based on a combination of subject and object attributes plus any context-sensitive or system-wide attributes. As well as group/role memberships, these attributes could include information about the OS currently being used, the IP address, or the presence of up-to-date patches and anti-malware. An attribute-based system could monitor the number of events or alerts associated with a user account or with a resource, or track access requests to ensure they are consistent in terms of timing of requests or geographic location. It could be programmed to implement policies, such as M-of-N control and separation of duties.</p> <p>Privileged access management (PAM)\u00a0refers to policies, procedures, and technical controls to prevent the malicious abuse of privileged accounts and to mitigate risks from weak configuration control over privileges. These controls identify and document privileged accounts, giving visibility into their use, and manage the credentials used to access them (beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/privileged-access-management-pam).</p> <p>Conditional access is an example of rule-based access control. A conditional access system monitors account or device behavior throughout a session. If certain conditions are met, the account may be suspended or the user may be required to reauthenticate, perhaps using a 2-step verification method. The User Account Control (UAC) and sudo restrictions on privileged accounts are examples of conditional access. The user is prompted for confirmation or authentication when requests that require elevated privileges are made. Role-based rights management and ABAC systems can apply a number of criteria to conditional access, including location-based policies (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).</p> <p>Federation\u00a0is the notion that a network needs to be accessible to more than just a well-defined group of employees. In business, a company might need to make parts of its network open to partners, suppliers, and customers. The company can manage its employee accounts easily enough. Managing accounts for each supplier or customer internally may be more difficult. Federation means that the company trusts accounts created and managed by a different network. As another example, in the consumer world, a user might want to use both Google Apps and X (formerly Twitter). If Google and X establish a federated network for the purpose of authentication and authorization, then the user can log on to X using his or her Google credentials or vice versa.</p> <p>A federated network or cloud needs specific protocols and technologies to implement user identity assertions and transmit attestations between the principal, the relying party, and the identity provider.\u00a0Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)\u00a0is one such solution. SAML attestations (or authorizations) are written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Communications are established using HTTP/HTTPS and the\u00a0Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). These secure tokens are signed using the XML signature specification. The use of a digital signature allows the relying party to trust the identity provider. As an example of a SAML implementation, Amazon Web Services (AWS) can function as a SAML service provider. This allows companies using AWS to develop cloud applications to manage their customers' user identities and provide them with permissions on AWS without having to create accounts for them on AWS directly.</p> <p>Enforcing an\u00a0acceptable use policy (AUP)\u00a0is important to protect the organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment. Typically, the policy will forbid the use of equipment to defraud, to defame, or to obtain illegal material. It will prohibit the installation of unauthorized hardware or software and explicitly forbid actual or attempted snooping of confidential data that the employee is not authorized to access. Acceptable use guidelines must be reasonable and not interfere with employees' fundamental job duties or privacy rights. An organization's AUP may forbid use of Internet tools outside of work-related duties or restrict such use to break times.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/","title":"Securing Networks","text":""},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-9","title":"Lesson 9","text":"<p>A screened subnet uses two firewalls placed on either side of the DMZ. The edge firewall restricts traffic on the external/public interface and allows permitted traffic to the hosts in the DMZ. The edge firewall can be referred to as the screening firewall or router. The internal firewall filters communications between hosts in the DMZ and hosts on the LAN. This firewall is often described as the choke firewall. A choke point is a purposefully narrow gateway that facilitates better access control and easier monitoring. ![[Pasted image 20240216095643.png]]</p> <p>A DMZ can also be established using one router/firewall appliance with three network interfaces, referred to as triple-homed.

While a unique MAC address is assigned to each network interface by the vendor at the factory, it is simple to override it in software via OS commands, alterations to the network driver configuration, or using\u00a0packet crafting\u00a0software. This can lead to a variety of issues when investigating security incidents or when depending on MAC addresses as part of a security control, as the presented address of the device may not be reliable.</p> <p>An\u00a0ARP poisoning\u00a0attack uses a packet crafter, such as Ettercap, to broadcast unsolicited ARP reply packets. Because ARP has no security mechanism, the receiving devices trust this communication and update their MAC:IP address cache table with the spoofed address. The usual target will be the subnet's default gateway (the router that accesses other networks). If the ARP poisoning attack is successful, all traffic destined for remote networks will be sent to the attacker. The attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack, either by monitoring the communications and then forwarding them to the router to avoid detection, or modifying the packets before forwarding them. The attacker could also perform a denial of service attack by not forwarding the packets.</p> <p>Where ARP poisoning is directed at hosts,\u00a0MAC flooding\u00a0is used to attack a switch. The intention of the attacker is to exhaust the memory used to store the switch's MAC address table. The switch uses the\u00a0MAC address table\u00a0to determine which port to use to forward unicast traffic to its correct destination. Overwhelming the table can cause the switch to stop trying to apply MAC-based forwarding and flood unicast traffic out of all ports, working as a hub. This makes sniffing network traffic easier for the threat actor.</p> <p>Configuring\u00a0MAC filtering\u00a0on a switch means defining which MAC addresses are allowed to connect to a particular port. This can be done by creating a list of valid MAC addresses or by specifying a limit to the number of permitted addresses. For example, if port security is enabled with a maximum of two MAC addresses, the switch will record the first two MACs to connect to that port, but then drop any traffic from machines with different MAC addresses that try to connect (cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/lanswitch/command/reference/lsw_book/lsw_m1.html). This provides a guard against MAC flooding attacks.</p> <p>Another option is to configure\u00a0Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping. DHCP is the protocol that allows a server to assign IP address information to a client when it connects to the network. DHCP snooping inspects this traffic arriving on access ports to ensure that a host is not trying to spoof its MAC address. It can also be used to prevent rogue (or spurious) DHCP servers from operating on the network. With DHCP snooping, only DHCP messages from ports configured as trusted are allowed. Additionally dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), which can be configured alongside DHCP snooping, prevents a host attached to an untrusted port from flooding the segment with gratuitous ARP replies. DAI maintains a trusted database of IP:ARP mappings and ensures that ARP packets are validly constructed and use valid IP addresses</p> <p>The IEEE 802.1X standard defines a\u00a0port-based network access control (PNAC)\u00a0mechanism. PNAC means that the switch uses an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server\u00a0to authenticate the attached device before activating the port.\u00a0Network access control (NAC)\u00a0products can extend the scope of authentication to allow administrators to devise policies or profiles describing a minimum security configuration that devices must meet to be granted network access.</p> <p>Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) In\u00a0Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP), as with EAP-TLS, an encrypted tunnel is established between the supplicant and authentication server, but PEAP only requires a server-side public key certificate. The supplicant does not require a certificate. With the server authenticated to the supplicant, user authentication can then take place through the secure tunnel with protection against sniffing, password-guessing/dictionary, and on-path attacks. The user authentication method (also referred to as the \"inner\" method) can use either EAP-MS-CHAPv2 or EAP-GTC. The Generic Token Card (GTC) method transfers a token for authentication against a network directory or using a one-time password mechanism.</p> <p>EAP with Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) EAP-Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS)\u00a0is similar to PEAP. It uses a server-side certificate to establish a protected tunnel through which the user's authentication credentials can be transmitted to the authentication server. The main distinction from PEAP is that EAP-TTLS can use any inner authentication protocol (PAP or CHAP, for instance), while PEAP must use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 or EAP-GTC.\u00a0</p> <p>EAP with Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) EAP with Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST)\u00a0is similar to PEAP, but instead of using a certificate to set up the tunnel, it uses a Protected Access Credential (PAC), which is generated for each user from the authentication server's master key. The problem with EAP-FAST is in distributing (provisioning) the PAC securely to each user requiring access. The PAC can either be distributed via an out-of-band method or via a server with a digital certificate (but in the latter case, EAP-FAST does not offer much advantage over using PEAP). Alternatively, the PAC can be delivered via anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The problem here is that there is nothing to authenticate the access point to the user. A rogue access point could obtain enough of the user credential to perform an ASLEAP password cracking attack.</p> <p>Where a network attack uses low-level techniques, such as SYN or SYN/ACK flooding, an application attack targets vulnerabilities in the headers and payloads of specific application protocols. For example, one type of\u00a0amplification attack\u00a0targets DNS services with bogus queries. One of the advantages of this technique is that while the request is small, the response to a DNS query can be made to include a lot of information, so this is a very effective way of overwhelming the bandwidth of the victim network with much more limited resources on the attacker's botnet.</p> <p>Another option is to use\u00a0sinkhole\u00a0routing so that the traffic flooding a particular IP address is routed to a different network where it can be analyzed. Potentially some legitimate traffic could be allowed through, but the real advantage is to identify the source of the attack and devise rules to filter it. The target can then use low TTL DNS records to change the IP address  advertised for the service and try to allow legitimate traffic past the flood.</p> <p>There are two main types of load balancers: - Layer 4 load balancer\u2014basic load balancers make forwarding decisions on IP address and TCP/UDP port values, working at the transport layer of the OSI model. - Layer 7 load balancer (content switch)\u2014as web applications have become more complex, modern load balancers need to be able to make forwarding decisions based on application-level data, such as a request for a particular URL or data types like video or audio streaming. This requires more complex logic, but the processing power of modern appliances is sufficient to deal with this.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-10","title":"Lesson 10","text":"<p>A\u00a0packet filtering\u00a0firewall is configured by specifying a group of rules, called an access control list (ACL).

The vast majority of firewalls now incorporate some level of stateful inspection capability. Session data is stored in a\u00a0state table. When a packet arrives, the firewall checks it to confirm whether it belongs to an existing connection. If it does not, it applies the ordinary packet filtering rules to determine whether to allow it. Once the connection has been allowed, the firewall usually allows traffic to pass unmonitored, in order to conserve processing effort.</p> <p>An application-aware firewall can inspect the contents of packets at the application layer. One key feature is to verify the application protocol matches the port; to verify that malware isn't sending raw TCP data over port 80 just because port 80 is open, for instance. As another example, a web application firewall could analyze the HTTP headers and the HTML code present in HTTP packets to try to identify code that matches a pattern in its threat database. Application-aware firewalls have many different names, including application layer gateway, stateful multilayer inspection, or deep packet inspection. Application aware devices have to be configured with separate filters for each type of traffic (HTTP and HTTPS, SMTP/POP/IMAP, FTP, and so on).\u00a0Application aware firewalls\u00a0are very powerful, but they are not invulnerable. Their\u00a0complexity means that it is possible to craft DoS attacks against exploitable vulnerabilities in the firewall firmware. Also, the firewall cannot examine encrypted data packets, unless configured with an SSL/TLS inspector.</p> <p><code>iptables</code>\u00a0is a command line utility provided by many Linux distributions that allows administrators to edit the rules enforced by the Linux kernel firewall (linux.die.net/man/8/iptables).\u00a0iptables\u00a0works with chains, which apply to the different types of traffic, such as the INPUT chain for traffic destined for the local host. Each chain has a default policy set to DROP or ACCEPT traffic that does not match a rule. Each rule, processed in order, determines whether traffic matching the criteria is allowed or dropped.</p> <p>An\u00a0appliance firewall\u00a0is a stand-alone hardware firewall deployed to monitor traffic passing into and out of a network zone. A firewall appliance can be deployed in two ways: - Routed (layer 3)\u2014the firewall performs forwarding between subnets. Each interface on the firewall connects to a different  subnet and represents a different security zone. - Bridged (layer 2)\u2014the firewall inspects traffic passing between two nodes, such as a router and a switch. This is also referred to as transparent mode. The firewall does not have an IP interface (except for configuration management). It bridges the Ethernet interfaces between the two nodes. Despite performing forwarding at layer 2, the firewall can still inspect and filter traffic on the basis of the full range of packet headers. The typical use case for a transparent firewall is to deploy it without having to reconfigure subnets and reassign IP addresses on other devices.</p> <p>A forward proxy provides for protocol-specific outbound traffic. For example, you might deploy a web proxy that enables client computers on the LAN to connect to websites and secure websites on the Internet. This is a forward proxy that services TCP ports 80 and 443 for outbound traffic.</p> <p>Proxy servers can generally be classed as non-transparent or transparent. - A\u00a0non-transparent proxy\u00a0means that the client must be configured with the proxy server address and port number to use it. The port on which the proxy server accepts client connections is often configured as port 8080. - A\u00a0transparent (or forced or intercepting) proxy\u00a0intercepts client traffic without the client having to be reconfigured. A transparent proxy must be implemented on a switch or router or other inline network appliance.</p> <p>A\u00a0reverse proxy\u00a0server provides for protocol-specific inbound traffic. For security purposes, you might not want external hosts to be able to connect directly to application servers, such as web, email, and VoIP servers. Instead, you can deploy a reverse proxy on the network edge and configure it to listen for client requests from a public network (the Internet). The proxy applies filtering rules and if accepted, it creates the appropriate request for an application server within a DMZ. In addition, some reverse proxy servers can handle application-specific load balancing, traffic encryption, and caching, reducing the overhead on the application servers.</p> <p>An\u00a0intrusion detection system (IDS)\u00a0is a means of using software tools to provide real-time analysis of either network traffic or system and application logs. A\u00a0network-based IDS (NIDS)\u00a0captures traffic via a packet sniffer, referred to as a sensor. It analyzes the packets to identify malicious traffic and displays alerts to a console or dashboard.</p> <p>A NIDS, such as\u00a0Snort\u00a0(snort.org), Suricata (https://suricata.io/), or Zeek/Bro (zeek.org) performs passive detection. When traffic is matched to a detection signature, it raises an alert or generates a log entry, but does not block the source host. This type of passive sensor does not slow down traffic and is undetectable by the attacker. It does not have an IP address on the monitored network segment.</p> <p>Compared to the passive function of an IDS, an\u00a0intrusion prevention system (IPS)\u00a0can provide an active response to any network threats that it matches. One typical preventive measure is to end the TCP session, sending a TCP reset packet to the attacking host. Another option is for the IPS to apply a temporary filter on the firewall to block the attacker's IP address (shunning). Other advanced measures include throttling bandwidth to attacking hosts, applying complex firewall filters, and even modifying suspect packets to render them harmless. Finally, the appliance may be able to run a script or third-party  program to perform some other action not supported by the IPS software itself.</p> <p>While intrusion detection was originally produced as standalone software or appliances, its functionality very quickly became incorporated into a new generation of firewalls. The original\u00a0next-generation firewall (NGFW)\u00a0was released as far back as 2010 by Palo Alto. This product combined application-aware filtering with user account-based filtering and the ability to act as an intrusion prevention system (IPS). This approach was quickly adopted by competitor products. Subsequent firewall generations have added capabilities such as cloud inspection and combined features of different security technologies.</p> <p>Unified threat management (UTM)\u00a0refers to a security product that centralizes many types of security controls\u2014firewall, anti-malware, network intrusion prevention, spam filtering, content filtering, data loss prevention, VPN, cloud access gateway\u2014into a single appliance. This means that you can monitor and manage the controls from a single console. Nevertheless, UTM has some downsides. When defense is unified under a single system, this creates the potential for a single point of failure that could affect an entire network.</p> <p>Software designed to assist with managing security data inputs and provide reporting and alerting is often described as\u00a0security information and event management (SIEM). The core function of a\u00a0SIEM tool is to aggregate traffic data and logs. In addition to logs from Windows and Linux-based hosts, this could include switches, routers, firewalls, IDS sensors, vulnerability scanners, malware scanners, data loss prevention (DLP) systems, and databases.</p> <p>There are three main types of log collection: - Agent-based\u2014with this approach, you must install an agent service on each host. As events occur on the host, logging data is filtered, aggregated, and normalized at the host, then sent to the SIEM server for analysis and storage. - Listener/collector\u2014rather than installing an agent, hosts can be configured to push updates to the SIEM server using a protocol such as syslog or SNMP. A process runs on the management server to parse and normalize each log/monitoring source.     Syslog (tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164)\u00a0allows for centralized collection of events from multiple sources. It also provides an open format for event logging messages, and as such has become a de facto standard for logging of events from distributed systems. For example, syslog messages can be generated by Cisco routers and switches, as well as servers and workstations. - Sensor\u2014as well as log data, the SIEM might collect packet captures and traffic flow data from sniffers.</p> <p>Where collection and aggregation produce inputs, a SIEM is also used for reporting. A critical function of SIEM\u2014and the principal factor distinguishing it from basic log management\u2014is that of correlation. This means that the SIEM software can link individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Correlation can then be used to drive an alerting system. These reports would be viewed from the SIEM dashboard. Basic correlation can be performed using simple If\u2026Then type rules. However, many SIEM solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as the basis for automated analysis.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges for behavior analytics driven by machine learning is to identify intent. It is extremely difficult for a machine to establish the context and interpretation of statements in natural language, though much progress is being made. The general efforts in this area are referred to as\u00a0sentiment analysis, or emotion AI. The typical use case for sentiment analysis is to monitor social media for brand \"incidents,\" such as a disgruntled customer announcing on Twitter what poor customer service they have just received. In terms of security, this can be used to gather threat intelligence and try to identify external or insider threats before they can develop as attacks.</p> <p>Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is designed as a solution to the problem of the volume of alerts overwhelming analysts' ability to respond. A SOAR may be implemented as a standalone technology or integrated with a SIEM\u2014often referred to as a next-gen SIEM. The basis of SOAR is to scan the organization's store of security and threat intelligence, analyze it using machine/deep learning techniques, and then use that data to automate and provide data enrichment for the workflows that drive incident response and threat hunting.</p> <p>The following list illustrates some commonly used elements of regex syntax: - [ \u2026 ]\u00a0matches a single instance of a character within the brackets. This can include literals, ranges such as\u00a0[a-z], and token matches, such as\u00a0[\\s]\u00a0(white space) or\u00a0[\\d]\u00a0(one digit). - +\u00a0matches one or more occurrences. A quantifier is placed after the term to match; for example,\u00a0\\s+\u00a0matches one or more white space characters. - *\u00a0matches zero or more times. - ?\u00a0matches once or not at all. - {}\u00a0matches a number of times. For example,\u00a0{2}\u00a0matches two times,\u00a0{2,}\u00a0matches two or more times, and\u00a0{2,5}\u00a0matches two to five times.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-11","title":"Lesson 11","text":"<p>DNS poisoning\u00a0is an attack that compromises the process by which clients query name servers to locate the IP address for a\u00a0Fully Qualified Domain Name\u00a0(FQDN). There are several ways that a DNS poisoning attack can be perpetrated.</p> <p>DNS footprinting means obtaining information about a private network by using its DNS server to perform a zone transfer (all the records in a domain) to a rogue DNS or simply by querying the DNS service, using a tool such as\u00a0nslookup\u00a0or\u00a0dig. To prevent this, you can apply an Access Control List to prevent zone transfers to unauthorized hosts or domains, to prevent an external server from obtaining information about the private network architecture.</p> <p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)\u00a0help to mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks by providing a validation process for DNS responses. With DNSSEC enabled, the authoritative server for the zone creates a \"package\" of resource records (called an RRset) signed with a private key (the Zone Signing Key). When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can be used to verify the signature.</p> <p>Most directory services are based on the\u00a0Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), running over port 389. The basic protocol provides no security and all transmissions are in plaintext, making it vulnerable to sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Authentication (referred to as binding to the server) can be implemented in the following ways: - No authentication\u2014anonymous access is granted to the directory. - Simple bind\u2014the client must supply its distinguished name (DN) and password, but these are passed as plaintext. - Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)\u2014the client and server negotiate the use of a supported authentication mechanism, such as Kerberos. The STARTTLS command can be used to require encryption (sealing) and message integrity (signing). This is the preferred mechanism for Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) implementation of LDAP. - LDAP Secure (LDAPS)\u2014the server is installed with a digital certificate, which it uses to set up a secure tunnel for the user credential exchange. LDAPS uses port 636.</p> <p>IPSec's encryption and hashing functions depend on a shared secret. The secret must be communicated to both hosts and the hosts must confirm one another's identity (mutual authentication). Otherwise, the connection is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and spoofing attacks. The\u00a0Internet Key Exchange (IKE)\u00a0protocol handles authentication and key exchange, referred to as Security Associations (SA).</p> <p>Remote management methods can be described as either in-band or\u00a0out-of-band (OOB). An in-band management link is one that shares traffic with other communications on the \"production\" network. A serial console or modem port on a router is a physically out-of-band management method. When using a browser-based management interface or a virtual terminal over Ethernet and IP, the link can be made out-of-band by connecting the port used for management access to physically separate network infrastructure. This can be costly to implement, but out-of-band management is more secure and means that access to the device is preserved when there are problems affecting the production network. With an in-band connection, better security can be implemented by using a VLAN to isolate management traffic. This makes it harder for potential eavesdroppers to view or modify traffic passing over the management interface. This sort of virtual OOB does still mean that access could be compromised by a system-wide network failure, however.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-12","title":"Lesson 12","text":"<p>A\u00a0hardware Root of Trust (RoT)\u00a0or trust anchor is a secure subsystem that is able to provide attestation. Attestation means that a statement made by the system can be trusted by the receiver. For example, when a computer joins a network, it might submit a report to the network access control (NAC) server declaring, \"My operating system files have not been replaced with malicious versions.\" The hardware root of trust is used to scan the boot metrics and OS files to verify their signatures, then it signs the report. The NAC server can trust the signature and therefore the report contents if it can trust that the signing entity's private key is secure.</p> <p>The RoT is usually established by a type of cryptoprocessor called a\u00a0trusted platform module (TPM).</p> <p>One of the drawbacks of FDE is that, because the OS performs the cryptographic operations, performance is reduced. This issue is mitigated by\u00a0self-encrypting drives (SED), where the cryptographic operations are performed by the drive controller. The SED uses a symmetric data/media encryption key (DEK/MEK) for bulk encryption and stores the DEK securely by encrypting it with an asymmetric key pair called either the authentication key (AK) or\u00a0key encryption key (KEK). Use of the AK is authenticated by the user password. This means that the user password can be changed without having to decrypt and re-encrypt the drive. Early types of SEDs used proprietary mechanisms, but many vendors now develop to the\u00a0Opal\u00a0Storage Specification (nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/TCGandNVMe_Joint_White_Paper-TCG_Storage_Opal_and_NVMe_FINAL.pdf), developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).</p> <ul> <li>Memorandum of understanding (MOU)\u2014A preliminary or exploratory agreement to express an intent to work together.

NDAs are used between companies and employees, between companies and contractors, and between two companies.

This can be applied to cybersecurity procedures, such as vulnerability and threat detection and response. A measurement systems analysis (MSA) is a means of evaluating the data collection and statistical methods used by a quality management process to ensure they are robust. This might be an onboarding requirement when partnering with enterprise companies or government agencies.</li> </ul> <p>Endpoint protection usually depends on an agent running on the local host. If multiple security products install multiple agents (say one for A-V, one for HIDS, another for host-based firewall, and so on), they can impact system performance and cause conflicts, creating numerous technical support incidents and security incident false positives. An endpoint protection platform (EPP) is a single agent performing multiple security tasks, including malware/intrusion detection and prevention, but also other security features, such as a host firewall, web content filtering/secure search and browsing, and file/message encryption.</p> <p>Many EPPs include a data loss prevention (DLP) agent. This is configured with policies to identify privileged files and strings that should be kept private or confidential, such as credit card numbers. The agent enforces the policy to prevent data from being copied or attached to a message without authorization.</p> <p>An\u00a0endpoint detection and response (EDR)\u00a0product's aim is not to prevent initial execution, but to provide real-time and historical visibility into the compromise, contain the malware within a single host, and facilitate remediation of the host to its original state. The term EDR was coined by Gartner security researcher Anton Chuvakin, and Gartner produces annual \"Magic Quadrant\" reports for both EPP (gartner.com/en/documents/3848470) and EDR functionality within security suites (gartner.com/en/documents/3894086/market-guide-for-endpoint-detection-and-response-solutio). Where earlier endpoint protection suites report to an on-premises management server, next-generation endpoint agents are more likely to be managed from a cloud portal and use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to perform user and entity behavior analysis. These analysis resources would be part of the security service provider's offering</p> <p>A\u00a0field programmable gate array (FPGA)\u00a0is a type of controller that solves this problem. The structure of the controller is not fully set at the time of manufacture. The end customer can configure the programming logic of the device to run a specific application.</p> <p>Many embedded systems operate devices that perform acutely time-sensitive tasks, such as drip meters or flow valves. The kernels or operating systems that run these devices must be much more stable and reliable than the OS that runs a desktop computer or server. Embedded systems typically cannot tolerate reboots or crashes and must have response times that are predictable to within microsecond tolerances. Consequently, these systems often use differently engineered platforms called\u00a0real-time operating systems (RTOS). An RTOS should be designed to have as small an attack surface as possible. An RTOS is still susceptible to CVEs and exploits, however.</p> <p>Industrial control systems (ICSs)\u00a0provide mechanisms for workflow and process automation. These systems control machinery used in critical infrastructure, like power suppliers, water suppliers, health services, telecommunications, and national security services. An ICS that manages process automation within a single site is usually referred to as a distributed control system (DCS).</p> <p>A\u00a0supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\u00a0system takes the place of a control server in large-scale, multiple-site ICSs. SCADA typically run as software on ordinary computers, gathering data from and managing plant devices and equipment with embedded PLCs, referred to as field devices.

These subsystems are implemented by PLCs and various types of sensors that measure temperature, air pressure, humidity, room occupancy, and so on. Some typical vulnerabilities that affect these systems include: - Process and memory vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, in the PLCs. These may arise from processing maliciously crafted packets in the automation management protocol. Building automation uses dedicated network protocols, such as BACnet or Dynet. - Use of plaintext credentials or cryptographic keys within application code. - Code injection via the graphical web application interfaces used to configure and monitor systems. This can be used to perform JavaScript-based attacks, such as clickjacking and cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-13","title":"Lesson 13","text":"<ul> <li>Mobile device management (MDM)\u2014sets device policies for authentication, feature use (camera and microphone), and connectivity.

For example, smartphones now allow users to disable screen locks when the device detects that it is in a trusted location, such as the home. Conversely, an enterprise may seek more stringent access controls to prevent misuse of a device. For example, even if the device has been unlocked, accessing a corporate workspace might require the user to authenticate again.

This is referred to as\u00a0arbitrary code execution. Where the code is transmitted from one machine to another, it can be referred to as\u00a0remote code execution. The code would typically be designed to install some sort of backdoor or to disable the system in some way (denial of service).</p> <p>There are two main types of\u00a0privilege escalation: - Vertical privilege escalation\u00a0(or elevation) is where a user or application can access functionality or data that should not be available to them. For instance, a process might run with local administrator privileges, but a vulnerability allows the arbitrary code to run with higher system privileges. - Horizontal privilege escalation\u00a0is where a user accesses functionality or data that is intended for another user. For instance, via a process running with local administrator privileges on a client workstation, the arbitrary code is able to execute as a domain account on an application server.</p> <p>A buffer is an area of memory that the application reserves to store expected data. To exploit a\u00a0buffer overflow\u00a0vulnerability, the attacker passes data that deliberately overfills the buffer. One of the most common vulnerabilities is a stack overflow. The stack is an area of memory used by a program subroutine. It includes a return address, which is the location of the program that has called the subroutine. An attacker could use a buffer overflow to change the return address, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the system.</p> <p>Integers (whole numbers) are widely used as a data type, where they are commonly defined with fixed lower and upper bounds. An\u00a0integer overflow\u00a0attack causes the target software to calculate a value that exceeds these bounds. This may cause a positive number to become negative (changing a bank debit to a credit, for instance). It could also be used where the software is calculating a buffer size.</p> <p>In C/C++ programming, a pointer is a variable that stores a memory location, rather than a value. Attempting to read or write that memory address via the pointer is called dereferencing. If the memory location is invalid or null (perhaps by some malicious process altering the execution environment), this creates a null\u00a0pointer dereference\u00a0type of exception, and the process will\u00a0crash, probably. In some circumstances, this might also allow a threat actor to run arbitrary code. A race condition is one means of engineering a null pointer dereference exception.\u00a0Race conditions\u00a0occur when the outcome from an execution process is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. In 2016, the Linux kernel was discovered to have an exploitable race condition vulnerability, known as Dirty COW (theregister.com/2016/10/21/linux_privilege_escalation_hole).</p> <p>DLL injection\u00a0is a vulnerability in the way the operating system allows one process to attach to another. This functionality can be abused by malware to force a legitimate process to load a malicious link library. The link library will contain whatever functions the malware author wants to be able to run. Malware uses this technique to move from one host process to another to avoid detection. A process that has been compromised by DLL injection might open unexpected network connections, or interact with files and the registry suspiciously.</p> <p>One common credential exploit technique for lateral movement is called\u00a0pass the hash (PtH). This is the process of harvesting an account's cached credentials when the user is logged into a single sign-on (SSO) system so the attacker can use the credentials on other systems. If the threat actor can obtain the hash of a user password, it is possible to present the hash (without cracking it) to authenticate to network protocols such as the Windows File Sharing protocol Server Message Block (SMB), and other protocols that accept Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes as authentication credentials. For example, most Windows domain networks are configured to allow NTLM as a legacy authentication method for services. The attacker's access isn't just limited to a single host, as they can pass the hash onto any computer in the network that is tied to the domain. This drastically cuts down on the effort the threat actor must spend in moving from host to host.</p> <p>Session management is often vulnerable to different kinds of replay attacks. To establish a session, the server normally gives the client some type of token. A\u00a0replay attack\u00a0works by sniffing or guessing the token value and then submitting it to re-establish the session illegitimately.</p> <p>In the context of a web application,\u00a0session hijacking\u00a0most often means replaying a cookie in some way. Attackers can sniff network traffic to obtain session cookies sent over an unsecured network, like a public Wi-Fi hotspot. To counter cookie hijacking, you can encrypt cookies during the transmission process, delete cookies from the client's browser cache when the client terminates the session, and design your web app to deliver a new cookie with each new session between the app and the client's browser.</p> <p>A web application is likely to use\u00a0Structured Query Language (SQL)\u00a0to read and write information from a database. The main database operations are performed by SQL statements for selecting data (SELECT), inserting data (INSERT), deleting data (DELETE), and updating data (UPDATE). In a\u00a0SQL injection\u00a0attack, the threat actor modifies one or more of these four basic functions by adding code to some input accepted by the app, causing it to execute the attacker's own set of SQL queries or parameters. If successful, this could allow the attacker to extract or insert information into the database or execute arbitrary code on the remote system using the same privileges as the database application (owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).</p> <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML)\u00a0is used by apps for authentication and authorizations, and for other types of data exchange and uploading. Data submitted via XML with no encryption or input validation is vulnerable to spoofing, request forgery, and injection of arbitrary data or code. For example, an XML External Entity (XXE) attack embeds a request for a local resource (owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).</p> <p>Directory traversal\u00a0is another type of injection attack performed against a web server. The threat actor submits a request for a file outside the web server's root directory by submitting a path to navigate to the parent directory (../). This attack can succeed if the input is not filtered properly and access permissions on the file are the same as those on the web server directory.</p> <p>A primary vector for attacking applications is to exploit faulty\u00a0input validation. Input could include user data entered into a form or URL passed by another application as a URL or HTTP header. Malicious input could be crafted to perform an overflow attack or some type of script or SQL injection attack. To mitigate this risk, all input methods should be documented with a view to reducing the potential attack surface exposed by the application. There must be routines to check user input, and anything that does not conform to what is required must be rejected.</p> <p>observing malware in a sandbox, it is helpful to consider the main types of malicious activity: - Shellcode\u2014this is a minimal program designed to exploit a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability to gain privileges, or to drop a backdoor on the host if run as a Trojan (attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002). Having gained a foothold, this type of attack will be followed by some type of network connection to download additional tools. - Credential dumping\u2014the malware might try to access the credentials file (SAM on a local Windows workstation) or sniff credentials held in memory by the lsass.exe system process (attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006). - Lateral movement/insider attack\u2014the general procedure is to use the foothold to execute a process remotely, using a tool such as psexec (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) or PowerShell (attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008).\u00a0The attacker might be seeking data assets or may try to widen access by changing the system security configuration, such as opening a firewall port or creating an account. If the attacker has compromised an account, these commands can blend in with ordinary network operations, though they could be anomalous behavior for that account. - Persistence\u2014this is a mechanism that allows the threat actor's backdoor to\u00a0restart if the host reboots or the user logs off (attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003). Typical methods are to use AutoRun keys in the registry, adding a scheduled task, or using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions.</p> <p>Continuous integration (CI)\u00a0is the principle that developers should commit and test updates often\u2014every day or sometimes even more frequently. This is designed to reduce the chances of two developers spending time on code changes that are later found to conflict with one another. CI aims to detect and resolve these conflicts early, as it is easier to diagnose one or two conflicts or build errors than it is to diagnose the causes of tens of them. For effective CI, it is important to use an automated test suite to validate each build quickly.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-15","title":"Lesson 15","text":"<p>![[Pasted image 20240219095251.png]] SEC as a SERVICE - Consultants\u2014the experience and perspective of a third-party professional can be hugely useful in improving security awareness and capabilities in any type of organization (small to large). Consultants could be used for \"big picture\" framework analysis and alignment or for more specific or product-focused projects (pen testing, SIEM rollout, and so on). It is also fairly simple to control costs when using consultants if they are used to develop capabilities rather than implement them. Where consultants come to \"own\" the security function, it can be difficult to change or sever the relationship. - Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP)\u2014a means of fully outsourcing responsibility for information assurance to a third party. This type of solution is expensive but can be a good fit for a SMB\u00a0that has experienced rapid growth and has no in-house security capability. Of course, this type of outsourcing places a huge amount of trust in the MSSP. Maintaining effective oversight of the MSSP requires a good degree of internal security awareness and expertise. There could also be significant challenges in industries exposed to high degrees of regulation in terms of information processing. - Security as a Service (SECaaS)\u2014can mean lots of different things, but is typically distinguished from an MSSP as being a means of implementing a particular security control, such as virus scanning or SIEM-like functionality, in the cloud. Typically, there would be a connector to the cloud service installed locally. For example, an antivirus agent would scan files locally but be managed and updated from the cloud provider; similarly a log collector would submit events to the cloud service for aggregation and correlation. Examples include Cloudflare (cloudflare.com/saas), Mandiant/FireEye (fireeye.com/mandiant/managed-detection-and-response.html), and SonicWall (sonicwall.com/solutions/service-provider/security-as-a-service).</p> <p>VM escaping\u00a0refers to malware running on a guest OS jumping to another guest or to the host. To do this, the malware must identify that it is running in a virtual environment, which is usually simple to do. One means of doing so is through a timing attack. The classic timing attack is to send multiple usernames to an authentication server and measure the server response times. An invalid username will usually be rejected very quickly, but a valid one will take longer (while the authentication server checks the password). This allows the attacker to harvest valid usernames. Malware can use a timing attack within a guest OS to detect whether it is running in a VM (certain operations may take a distinct amount of time compared to a \"real\" environment).</p> <p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA)\u00a0conceives of atomic services closely mapped to business workflows. Each service takes defined inputs and produces defined outputs. The service may itself be composed of sub-services. The key features of a service function are that it is self-contained, does not rely on the state of other services, and exposes clear input/output (I/O) interfaces. Because each service has a simple interface, interoperability is made much easier than with a complex monolithic application. The implementation of a service does not constrain compatibility choices for client services, which can use a different platform or development language. This independence of the service and the client requesting the service is referred to as loose coupling.</p> <p>Microservice-based development shares many similarities with Agile software project management and the processes of continuous delivery and deployment. It also shares roots with the Unix philosophy that each program or tool should do one thing well. The main difference between SOA and microservices is that SOA allows a service to be built from other services. By contrast, each microservice should be capable of being developed, tested, and deployed independently.</p> <p>Services integration refers to ways of making these decoupled service or microservice components work together to perform a workflow. Where SOA used the concept of an enterprise service bus, microservices integration and cloud services/virtualization/automation integration generally is very often implemented using orchestration tools. Where automation focuses on making a single, discrete task easily repeatable,\u00a0orchestration\u00a0performs a sequence of automated tasks. For example, you might orchestrate adding a new VM to a load-balanced cluster. This end-to-end process might include provisioning the VM, configuring it, adding the new VM to the load-balanced cluster, and reconfiguring the load-balancing weight distribution given the new cluster configuration. In doing this, the orchestrated steps would have to run numerous automated scripts or API service calls.</p> <p>The serverless paradigm eliminates the need to manage physical or virtual server instances, so there is no management effort for software and patches, administration privileges, or file system security monitoring. There is no requirement to provision multiple servers for redundancy or load balancing. As all of the processing is taking place within the cloud, there is little emphasis on the provision of a corporate network.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/Securing%20Networks/#lesson-16","title":"Lesson 16","text":"<p>A\u00a0data governance\u00a0policy describes the security controls that will be applied to protect data at each stage of its life cycle. There are important institutional governance roles for oversight and management of information assets within the life cycle: - Data owner\u2014a\u00a0senior (executive) role with ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset. The owner is responsible for labeling the asset (such as determining who should have access and determining the asset's criticality and sensitivity) and ensuring that it is protected with appropriate controls (access control, backup, retention, and so forth). The owner also typically selects a steward and custodian and directs their actions and sets the budget and resource allocation for sufficient controls. - Data steward\u2014this role is primarily responsible for data quality. This involves tasks such as ensuring data is labeled and identified with appropriate metadata and that data is collected and stored in a format and with values that comply with applicable laws and regulations. - Data custodian\u2014this role handles managing the system on which the data assets are stored. This includes responsibility for enforcing access control, encryption, and backup/recovery measures. - Data Privacy Officer (DPO)\u2014this role is responsible for oversight of any personally identifiable information (PII) assets managed by the company. The privacy officer ensures that the processing, disclosure, and retention of PII complies with legal and regulatory frameworks. In the context of legislation and regulations protecting personal privacy, the following two institutional roles are important: - Data controller\u2014the entity responsible for determining why and how data is stored, collected, and used and for ensuring that these purposes and means are lawful. The data controller has ultimate responsibility for privacy breaches, and is not permitted to transfer that responsibility. - Data processor\u2014an entity engaged by the data controller to assist with technical collection, storage, or analysis tasks. A data processor follows the instructions of a data controller with regard to collection or processing.</p> <ul> <li>Interconnection security agreement (ISA)\u2014ISAs are defined by NIST's SP800-47 \"Managing the Security of Information Exchanges\" (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-47r1.pdf). Any federal agency interconnecting its IT system to a third party must create an ISA to govern the relationship. An ISA sets out a security risk awareness process and commits the agency and supplier to implementing security controls.</li> </ul> <p>Unauthorized copying or retrieval of data from a system is referred to as\u00a0data exfiltration. Data exfiltration attacks are one of the primary means for attackers to retrieve valuable data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or payment information, often destined for later sale on the black market. Data exfiltration can take place via a wide variety of mechanisms, including:</p> <p>Data loss prevention (DLP)\u00a0products automate the discovery and classification of data types and enforce rules so that data is not viewed or transferred without a proper authorization. Such solutions will usually consist of the following components: - Policy server\u2014to configure classification, confidentiality, and privacy rules and policies, log incidents, and compile reports. - Endpoint agents\u2014to enforce policy on client computers, even when they are not connected to the network. - Network agents\u2014to scan communications at network borders and interface with web and messaging servers to enforce policy.</p> <p>Data minimization\u00a0is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if that is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected. In order to prove compliance with the principle of data minimization, each process that uses personal data should be documented. The workflow can supply evidence of why processing and storage of a particular field or data point is required. Data minimization affects the data retention policy. It is necessary to track how long a data point has been stored for since it was collected and whether continued retention supports a legitimate processing function. Another impact is on test environments, where the minimization principle forbids the use of real data records.</p>"},{"location":"Security%2B/notes/","title":"Notes","text":"<p>Just a way I remember the SDLC Phases: Planning (Planning and Analysis) School (Software/Systems Design) Is (Implementation) Tough (Testing) In (Integration) Detroit (Deployment) Michigan (Maintenance)</p> <p>I'd highly recommend knowing the attack types or the various plans/strategies/policies to prevent bad stuff from happening (think business continuity, RPO, RTO, MTRP, MTBF, etc.)</p> <p>But like others have said make sure you understand the acronyms and understand the different types of attacks and how to mitigate them.</p> <p>Tips: Understand the type of attacks, ACLs, what tools do what (think of tools you may find on a Kali machine), and understand asymmetric vs symmetric.</p>"}]}
